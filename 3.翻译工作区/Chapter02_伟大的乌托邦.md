## 第一节:社会主义作为自由理想的继承者

[原文]
> That socialism has displaced liberalism as the doctrine held by the great majority of progressives does not simply mean that people had forgotten the warnings of the great liberal thinkers of the past about the consequences of collectivism. <!-- p1.s1 -->

[译文]
社会主义取代自由主义,成为了绝大多数进步人士信奉的学说。这不仅仅意味着人们忘记了过去伟大的自由主义思想家关于集体主义后果的警告。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> It has happened because they were persuaded of the very opposite of what these men had predicted. <!-- p1.s2 -->

[译文]
这种转变之所以发生,是因为人们被说服，相信了与这些思想家预言完全相反的东西。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> The extraordinary thing is that the same socialism that was not only early recognized as the gravest threat to freedom, but quite openly began as a reaction against the liberalism of the French Revolution, gained general acceptance under the flag of liberty. <!-- p1.s3 -->

[译文]
非同寻常的是,同样是这个社会主义,它不仅很早就被认为是对自由的最严重威胁,而且公开地以反对法国大革命的自由主义而起家,却在自由的旗帜下获得了普遍接受。<!-- p1.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is rarely remembered now that socialism in its beginnings was frankly authoritarian. <!-- p2.s1 -->

[译文]
现在人们很少记得,社会主义在其起源时是坦率的威权主义。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> The French writers who laid the foundations of modern socialism had no doubt that their ideas could be put into practice only by a strong dictatorial government. <!-- p2.s2 -->

[译文]
奠定现代社会主义基础的法国作家们毫不怀疑:他们的思想只有通过一个强大的独裁政府才能付诸实践。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> To them socialism meant an attempt to "terminate the revolution" by a deliberate reorganization of society on hierarchical lines and by the imposition of a coercive "spiritual power." <!-- p2.s3 -->

[译文]
对他们来说,社会主义意味着一种尝试:"终结革命"。方法是按照等级路线刻意重组社会,并强加一种强制性的"精神权力"。<!-- p2.s3 -->

[原文]
> Where freedom was concerned, the founders of socialism made no bones about their intentions. <!-- p2.s4 -->

[译文]
在自由问题上,社会主义的创始人对他们的意图毫不掩饰。<!-- p2.s4 -->

[原文]
> Freedom of thought they regarded as the root-evil of nineteenth-century society, and the first of modern planners, Saint-Simon, even predicted that those who did not obey his proposed planning boards would be "treated as cattle." <!-- p2.s5 -->

[译文]
他们把思想自由视为十九世纪社会的根本罪恶。第一位现代计划者圣西门甚至预言:那些不服从他提议的计划委员会的人将"被当作牲畜对待"。[注-原-2]<!-- p2.s5 -->

[原文]
> Only under the influence of the strong democratic currents preceding the revolution of 1848 did socialism begin to ally itself with the forces of freedom. <!-- p3.s1 -->

[译文]
只有在1848年革命之前强大的民主潮流的影响下,社会主义才开始与自由的力量结盟。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> But it took the new "democratic socialism" a long time to live down the suspicions aroused by its antecedents. <!-- p3.s2 -->

[译文]
但这种新的"民主社会主义"花了很长时间才消除其前身所引起的怀疑。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> Nobody saw more clearly than Tocqueville that democracy as an essentially individualist institution stood in an irreconcilable conflict with socialism: <!-- p3.s3 -->

[译文]
没有人比托克维尔看得更清楚:民主作为一种本质上的个人主义制度,与社会主义处于不可调和的冲突之中。<!-- p3.s3 -->

[原文]
> "Democracy extends the sphere of individual freedom," he said in 1848; "socialism restricts it. Democracy attaches all possible value to each man; socialism makes each man a mere agent, a mere number. Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word: equality. But notice the difference: while democracy seeks equality in liberty, socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude." <!-- p3.s4 -->

[译文]
他在1848年说:"民主扩大个人自由的范围,社会主义限制它。民主赋予每个人一切可能的价值,社会主义使每个人仅仅成为一个工具、一个编号。民主与社会主义除了“平等”一词之外没有任何共同之处。但请注意区别:民主在自由中寻求平等,社会主义在束缚和奴役中寻求平等。"[注-原-3]<!-- p3.s4 -->

## 第二节:集体主义的新自由承诺

[原文]
> To allay these suspicions and to harness to its cart the strongest of all political motives—the craving for freedom—socialism began increasingly to make use of the promise of a "new freedom." <!-- p4.s1 -->

[译文]
为了消除这些怀疑,为了把最强大的政治动机——对自由的渴望——套在自己的战车上,社会主义开始越来越多地利用"新自由"的承诺。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> The coming of socialism was to be the leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. <!-- p4.s2 -->

[译文]
社会主义的到来将是从必然王国到自由王国的飞跃。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> It was to bring "economic freedom," without which the political freedom already gained was "not worth having." <!-- p4.s3 -->

[译文]
它将带来"经济自由"。没有经济自由,已经获得的政治自由就"不值得拥有"。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> Only socialism was capable of effecting the consummation of the age-long struggle for freedom, in which the attainment of political freedom was but a first step. <!-- p4.s4 -->

[译文]
只有社会主义才能完成争取自由的千年斗争。在这场斗争中,获得政治自由只是第一步。<!-- p4.s4 -->

[原文]
> The subtle change in meaning to which the word "freedom" was subjected in order that this argument should sound plausible is important. <!-- p5.s1 -->

[译文]
为了使这个论证听起来合理,"自由"一词的含义发生了微妙的变化。这种变化很重要。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> To the great apostles of political freedom the word had meant freedom from coercion, freedom from the arbitrary power of other men, release from the ties which left the individual no choice but obedience to the orders of a superior to whom he was attached. <!-- p5.s2 -->

[译文]
对于政治自由的伟大使徒来说,这个词意味着免于强制的自由,免于他人任意权力的自由,摆脱那些使个人除了服从其所依附的上级命令之外别无选择的束缚。<!-- p5.s2 -->

[原文]
> The new freedom promised, however, was to be freedom from necessity, release from the compulsion of the circumstances which inevitably limit the range of choice of all of us, although for some very much more than for others. <!-- p5.s3 -->

[译文]
然而,所承诺的新自由是免于必然性的自由,是摆脱环境强制的自由——这种环境不可避免地限制了我们所有人的选择范围,尽管对某些人的限制比对其他人要大得多。<!-- p5.s3 -->

[原文]
> Before man could be truly free, the "despotism of physical want" had to be broken, the "restraints of the economic system" relaxed. <!-- p5.s4 -->

[译文]
在人能够真正自由之前,必须打破"物质匮乏的专制",必须放松"经济制度的束缚"。<!-- p5.s4 -->

[原文]
> Freedom in this sense is, of course, merely another name for power or wealth. <!-- p6.s1 -->

[译文]
当然,这个意义上的自由不过是权力或财富的另一个名称。[注-原-4]<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> Yet, although the promises of this new freedom were often coupled with irresponsible promises of a great increase in material wealth in a socialist society, it was not from such an absolute conquest of the niggardliness of nature that economic freedom was expected. <!-- p6.s2 -->

[译文]
然而,尽管这种新自由的承诺常常伴随着不负责任的承诺——说社会主义社会将大大增加物质财富——但经济自由的期待并非来自对自然吝啬的这种绝对征服。<!-- p6.s2 -->

[原文]
> What the promise really amounted to was that the great existing disparities in the range of choice of different people were to disappear. <!-- p6.s3 -->

[译文]
这个承诺真正的意思是:不同人之间在选择范围上的巨大差距将会消失。<!-- p6.s3 -->

[原文]
> The demand for the new freedom was thus only another name for the old demand for an equal distribution of wealth. <!-- p6.s4 -->

[译文]
因此,对新自由的要求只不过是对财富平等分配的旧要求的另一个名称。<!-- p6.s4 -->

[原文]
> But the new name gave the socialists another word in common with the liberals, and they exploited it to the full. <!-- p6.s5 -->

[译文]
但这个新名称给了社会主义者与自由主义者的另一个共同词汇,他们充分利用了这一点。<!-- p6.s5 -->

[原文]
> And, although the word was used in a different sense by the two groups, few people noticed this and still fewer asked themselves whether the two kinds of freedom promised could really be combined. <!-- p6.s6 -->

[译文]
尽管这两个群体使用这个词的意义不同,但很少有人注意到这一点,更少有人问自己:所承诺的这两种自由真的能够结合吗?<!-- p6.s6 -->

[原文]
> There can be no doubt that the promise of greater freedom has become one of the most effective weapons of socialist propaganda and that the belief that socialism would bring freedom is genuine and sincere. <!-- p7.s1 -->

[译文]
毫无疑问,更大自由的承诺已经成为社会主义宣传最有效的武器之一。相信社会主义会带来自由的信念是真诚的。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> But this would only heighten the tragedy if it should prove that what was promised to us as the Road to Freedom was in fact the High Road to Servitude. <!-- p7.s2 -->

[译文]
但如果事实证明,向我们承诺的通往自由之路实际上是通往奴役的大道,这只会加剧悲剧。<!-- p7.s2 -->

[原文]
> Unquestionably, the promise of more freedom was responsible for luring more and more liberals along the socialist road, for blinding them to the conflict which exists between the basic principles of socialism and liberalism, and for often enabling socialists to usurp the very name of the old party of freedom. <!-- p7.s3 -->

[译文]
毫无疑问,更多自由的承诺诱使越来越多的自由主义者走上社会主义道路,使他们看不到社会主义与自由主义基本原则之间存在的冲突,并常常使社会主义者得以篡夺自由的老党派的名称。<!-- p7.s3 -->

[原文]
> Socialism was embraced by the greater part of the intelligentsia as the apparent heir of the liberal tradition: therefore it is not surprising that to them the idea of socialism's leading to the opposite of liberty should appear inconceivable. <!-- p7.s4 -->

[译文]
社会主义被大部分知识分子接受,视为自由主义传统的表面继承者。因此,对他们来说,社会主义导致自由的反面这个想法似乎是不可想象的,这并不奇怪。<!-- p7.s4 -->

## 第三节:自由概念的分裂与冲突

[原文]
> In recent years, however, the old apprehensions of the unforeseen consequences of socialism have once more been strongly voiced from the most unexpected quarters. <!-- p8.s1 -->

[译文]
然而,近年来,对社会主义未预见后果的旧有担忧再次从最意想不到的方面强烈地表达出来。<!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> Observer after observer, in spite of the contrary expectation with which he approached his subject, has been impressed with the extraordinary similarity in many respects of the conditions under "fascism" and "communism." <!-- p8.s2 -->

[译文]
一个又一个观察者,尽管他们带着相反的期待来研究这个问题,却对"法西斯主义"和"共产主义"下的条件在许多方面的非凡相似性印象深刻。<!-- p8.s2 -->

[原文]
> While "progressives" in England and elsewhere were still deluding themselves that communism and fascism represented opposite poles, more and more people began to ask themselves whether these new tyrannies were not the outcome of the same tendencies. <!-- p8.s3 -->

[译文]
当英国和其他地方的"进步人士"还在自欺欺人地认为共产主义和法西斯主义代表对立的两极时,越来越多的人开始问自己:这些新的暴政是否不是同样趋势的产物?<!-- p8.s3 -->

[原文]
> Even communists must have been somewhat shaken by such testimonies as that of Max Eastman, Lenin's old friend, who found himself compelled to admit that "instead of being better, Stalinism is worse than fascism, more ruthless, barbarous, unjust, immoral, antidemocratic, unredeemed by any hope or scruple," and that it is "better described as superfascist"; and when we find the same author recognizing that "Stalinism is socialism, in the sense of being an inevitable although unforeseen political accompaniment of the nationalization and collectivization which he had relied upon as part of his plan for erecting a classless society," his conclusion clearly achieves wider significance. <!-- p8.s4 -->

[译文]
即使是共产主义者也一定对马克斯·伊斯特曼这样的证词有所震动。伊斯特曼是列宁的老朋友,他发现自己不得不承认:"斯大林主义不是更好,而是比法西斯主义更糟,更残酷、更野蛮、更不公正、更不道德、更反民主,没有任何希望或顾忌可以救赎它。"他说斯大林主义"更好地被描述为超级法西斯主义"。当我们发现同一位作者认识到"斯大林主义就是社会主义,因为它是国有化和集体化不可避免的政治伴随物——尽管是未预见到的——而他曾依靠这些作为建立无阶级社会计划的一部分",他的结论显然具有更广泛的意义。[注-原-5]<!-- p8.s4 -->

[原文]
> Mr. Eastman's case is perhaps the most remarkable, yet he is by no means the first or the only sympathetic observer of the Russian experiment to form similar conclusions. <!-- p9.s1 -->

[译文]
伊斯特曼先生的情况也许是最引人注目的,但他绝不是第一个或唯一一个对俄国实验持同情态度却得出类似结论的观察者。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> Several years earlier W. H. Chamberlin, who in twelve years in Russia as an American correspondent had seen all his ideals shattered, summed up the conclusions of his studies there and in Germany and Italy in the statement that "socialism is certain to prove, in the beginning at least, the road NOT to freedom, but to dictatorship and counter-dictatorships, to civil war of the fiercest kind. Socialism achieved and maintained by democratic means seems definitely to belong to the world of utopias." <!-- p9.s2 -->

[译文]
几年前,W·H·张伯林在俄国作为美国记者度过了十二年,看到他所有的理想都破灭了。他总结了在俄国、德国和意大利的研究结论,指出:"社会主义肯定会证明,至少在开始时,不是通往自由的道路,而是通往独裁和反独裁、通往最激烈的内战的道路。通过民主手段实现和维持的社会主义似乎肯定属于乌托邦的世界。"[注-原-6]<!-- p9.s2 -->

[原文]
> Similarly a British writer, F. A. Voigt, after many years of close observation of developments in Europe as a foreign correspondent, concludes that "Marxism has led to Fascism and National Socialism, because, in all essentials, it is Fascism and National Socialism." <!-- p9.s3 -->

[译文]
同样,英国作家F·A·沃伊特作为驻外记者多年密切观察欧洲的发展后得出结论:"马克思主义导致了法西斯主义和国家社会主义,因为在所有本质方面,它就是法西斯主义和国家社会主义。"[注-原-7]<!-- p9.s3 -->

[原文]
> And Walter Lippmann has arrived at the conviction that "the generation to which we belong is now learning from experience what happens when men retreat from freedom to a coercive organization of their affairs. Though they promise themselves a more abundant life, they must in practice renounce it; as the organized direction increases, the variety of ends must give way to uniformity. That is the nemesis of the planned society and the authoritarian principle in human affairs." <!-- p9.s4 -->

[译文]
沃尔特·李普曼得出了这样的信念:"我们这一代人现在正从经验中学习:当人们从自由退却到对其事务的强制性组织时会发生什么。尽管他们向自己承诺更丰富的生活,但在实践中他们必须放弃它。随着有组织的指导增加,目标的多样性必须让位于统一性。这就是计划社会和人类事务中威权原则的报应。"[注-原-8]<!-- p9.s4 -->

[原文]
> Many more similar statements from people in a position to judge might be selected from publications of recent years, particularly from those by men who as citizens of the now totalitarian countries have lived through the transformation and have been forced by their experience to revise many cherished beliefs. <!-- p10.s1 -->

[译文]
从近年来的出版物中,特别是从那些作为现在极权主义国家公民经历了这种转变、并被迫根据经验修正许多珍视信念的人的著作中,可以选出更多有资格判断的人的类似陈述。<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> We shall quote as one more example a German writer who expresses the same conclusion perhaps more justly than those already quoted. <!-- p10.s2 -->

[译文]
我们将引用一位德国作家作为另一个例子,他表达同样结论的方式也许比已经引用的那些更公正。<!-- p10.s2 -->

[原文]
> "The complete collapse of the belief in the attainability of freedom and equality through Marxism," writes Peter Drucker, "has forced Russia to travel the same road toward a totalitarian, purely negative, non-economic society of unfreedom and inequality which Germany has been following. Not that communism and fascism are essentially the same. Fascism is the stage reached after communism has proved an illusion, and it has proved as much an illusion in Stalinist Russia as in pre-Hitler Germany." <!-- p10.s3 -->

[译文]
彼得·德鲁克写道:"通过马克思主义实现自由和平等的信念的彻底崩溃,迫使俄国走上了德国一直在走的同一条道路——通往一个极权主义的、纯粹消极的、非经济的不自由和不平等社会的道路。这并不是说共产主义和法西斯主义本质上是一样的。法西斯主义是共产主义被证明是幻觉之后达到的阶段,而它在斯大林主义的俄国和希特勒之前的德国都同样被证明是幻觉。"[注-原-9]<!-- p10.s3 -->

## 第四节:从自由到强制的转变

[原文]
> No less significant is the intellectual history of many of the Nazi and Fascist leaders. <!-- p11.s1 -->

[译文]
许多纳粹和法西斯领导人的思想历程同样意义重大。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> Everyone who has watched the growth of these movements in Italy or in Germany has been struck by the number of leading men, from Mussolini downward (and not excluding Laval and Quisling), who began as socialists and ended as Fascists or Nazis. <!-- p11.s2 -->

[译文]
每个观察过这些运动在意大利或德国成长的人都对领导人的数量感到震惊——从墨索里尼往下(包括拉瓦尔和吉斯林),他们都是以社会主义者开始,以法西斯主义者或纳粹分子结束。[注-原-10][注-原-11]<!-- p11.s2 -->

[原文]
> And what is true of the leaders is even more true of the rank and file of the movement. <!-- p11.s3 -->

[译文]
对领导人来说是这样,对运动的普通成员来说更是如此。<!-- p11.s3 -->

[原文]
> The relative ease with which a young communist could be converted into a Nazi or vice versa was generally known in Germany, best of all to the propagandists of the two parties. <!-- p11.s4 -->

[译文]
在德国,一个年轻的共产主义者可以相对容易地转变为纳粹,反之亦然,这是众所周知的。两党的宣传人员对此最清楚。<!-- p11.s4 -->

[原文]
> Many a university teacher during the 1930s has seen English and American students return from the Continent uncertain whether they were communists or Nazis and certain only that they hated Western liberal civilization. <!-- p11.s5 -->

[译文]
在1930年代,许多大学教师看到英国和美国学生从欧洲大陆回来,不确定自己是共产主义者还是纳粹,唯一确定的是他们憎恨西方自由文明。<!-- p11.s5 -->

[原文]
> It is true, of course, that in Germany before 1933, and in Italy before 1922, communists and Nazis or Fascists clashed more frequently with each other than with other parties. <!-- p12.s1 -->

[译文]
当然,在1933年之前的德国和1922年之前的意大利,共产主义者与纳粹或法西斯主义者之间的冲突比与其他政党的冲突更频繁,这是事实。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> They competed for the support of the same type of mind and reserved for each other the hatred of the heretic. <!-- p12.s2 -->

[译文]
他们争夺同一类型头脑的支持,并为彼此保留了对异端的仇恨。<!-- p12.s2 -->

[原文]
> But their practice showed how closely they are related. <!-- p12.s3 -->

[译文]
但他们的实践表明他们的关系有多么密切。<!-- p12.s3 -->

[原文]
> To both, the real enemy, the man with whom they had nothing in common and whom they could not hope to convince, is the liberal of the old type. <!-- p12.s4 -->

[译文]
对两者来说,真正的敌人,那个与他们没有任何共同之处、他们也不希望说服的人,是老式的自由主义者。<!-- p12.s4 -->

[原文]
> While to the Nazi the communist, and to the communist the Nazi, and to both the socialist, are potential recruits who are made of the right timber, although they have listened to false prophets, they both know that there can be no compromise between them and those who really believe in individual freedom. <!-- p12.s5 -->

[译文]
对纳粹来说,共产主义者是潜在的新兵;对共产主义者来说,纳粹是潜在的新兵;对两者来说,社会主义者也是潜在的新兵——他们都是用正确的木材制成的,尽管他们听从了假先知。但他们都知道,他们与那些真正相信个人自由的人之间不可能有妥协。<!-- p12.s5 -->

[原文]
> Lest this be doubted by people misled by official propaganda from either side, let me quote one more statement from an authority that ought not to be suspect. <!-- p13.s1 -->

[译文]
为了不让那些被任何一方官方宣传误导的人怀疑这一点,让我再引用一位不应受到怀疑的权威的陈述。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> In an article under the significant title of "The Rediscovery of Liberalism," Professor Eduard Heimann, one of the leaders of German religious socialism, writes: "Hitlerism proclaims itself as both true democracy and true socialism, and the terrible truth is that there is a grain of truth for such claims—an infinitesimal grain, to be sure, but at any rate enough to serve as a basis for such fantastic distortions. Hitlerism even goes so far as to claim the role of protector of Christianity, and the terrible truth is that even this gross misinterpretation is able to make some impression. But one fact stands out with perfect clarity in all the fog: Hitler has never claimed to represent true liberalism. Liberalism then has the distinction of being the doctrine most hated by Hitler." <!-- p13.s2 -->

[译文]
在一篇题为"自由主义的重新发现"的重要文章中,德国宗教社会主义领导人之一爱德华·海曼教授写道:"希特勒主义宣称自己既是真正的民主又是真正的社会主义,可怕的真相是,这样的主张确实有一丝真理——当然是极其微小的一丝,但无论如何足以作为这种荒诞扭曲的基础。希特勒主义甚至声称自己是基督教的保护者,可怕的真相是,即使是这种严重的曲解也能产生一些印象。但在所有迷雾中,有一个事实非常清楚地突出:希特勒从未声称代表真正的自由主义。因此,自由主义有一个特殊之处:它是希特勒最憎恨的学说。"[注-原-12]<!-- p13.s2 -->

[原文]
> It should be added that this hatred had little occasion to show itself in practice merely because, by the time Hitler came to power, liberalism was to all intents and purposes dead in Germany. <!-- p13.s3 -->

[译文]
应该补充的是,这种仇恨在实践中几乎没有机会表现出来,仅仅是因为当希特勒上台时,自由主义在德国实际上已经死了。<!-- p13.s3 -->

[原文]
> And it was socialism that had killed it. <!-- p13.s4 -->

[译文]
而杀死它的正是社会主义。<!-- p13.s4 -->

[原文]
> While to many who have watched the transition from socialism to fascism at close quarters the connection between the two systems has become increasingly obvious, in the democracies the majority of people still believe that socialism and freedom can be combined. <!-- p14.s1 -->

[译文]
对于许多近距离观察从社会主义到法西斯主义转变的人来说,这两个制度之间的联系已经变得越来越明显。然而在民主国家,大多数人仍然相信社会主义和自由可以结合。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> There can be no doubt that most socialists here still believe profoundly in the liberal ideal of freedom and that they would recoil if they became convinced that the realization of their program would mean the destruction of freedom. <!-- p14.s2 -->

[译文]
毫无疑问,这里的大多数社会主义者仍然深信自由主义的自由理想。如果他们确信实现他们的纲领将意味着摧毁自由,他们会退缩。<!-- p14.s2 -->

[原文]
> So little is the problem yet seen, so easily do the most irreconcilable ideals still live together, that we can still hear such contradictions in terms as "individualist socialism" seriously discussed. <!-- p14.s3 -->

[译文]
这个问题还很少被看到,最不可调和的理想仍然如此容易地共存,以至于我们仍然可以听到"个人主义社会主义"这样自相矛盾的术语被认真讨论。<!-- p14.s3 -->

[原文]
> If this is the state of mind which makes us drift into a new world, nothing can be more urgent than that we should seriously examine the real significance of the evolution that has taken place elsewhere. <!-- p14.s4 -->

[译文]
如果这就是使我们漂向一个新世界的心态,那么没有什么比我们认真审视在其他地方发生的演变的真正意义更紧迫的了。<!-- p14.s4 -->

[原文]
> Although our conclusions will only confirm the apprehensions which others have already expressed, the reasons why this development cannot be regarded as accidental will not appear without a rather full examination of the main aspects of this transformation of social life. <!-- p14.s5 -->

[译文]
尽管我们的结论只会证实其他人已经表达的担忧,但如果不对社会生活这种转变的主要方面进行相当全面的审查,就不会显现出为什么这种发展不能被视为偶然的原因。<!-- p14.s5 -->

[原文]
> That democratic socialism, the great utopia of the last few generations, is not only unachievable, but that to strive for it produces something so utterly different that few of those who now wish it would be prepared to accept the consequences, many will not believe until the connection has been laid bare in all its aspects. <!-- p14.s6 -->

[译文]
民主社会主义,过去几代人的伟大乌托邦,不仅是无法实现的,而且为之奋斗会产生如此完全不同的东西,以至于现在希望它的人中很少有人会准备接受其后果——许多人在这种联系的所有方面都被揭示出来之前不会相信这一点。<!-- p14.s6 -->

La démocratie donne toute sa valeur possible à chaque homme, le socialisme fait de chaque homme un agent, un instrument, un chiffre. La démocratie et le socialisme ne se tiennent que par un mot, l'égalité; mais remarquez la différence: la démocratie veut l'égalité dans la liberté, et le socialisme veut l'égalité dans la gêne et dans la servitude."

[注-原-4] 自由与权力的这种特征性混淆,我们将在整个讨论中一再遇到,这是一个太大的主题,无法在这里彻底审查。它与社会主义本身一样古老,与社会主义联系如此紧密,以至于近七十年前一位法国学者在讨论其圣西门起源时就说,这种自由理论"本身就是全部社会主义"(Paul Janet,《圣西门与圣西门主义》[巴黎:G. Baillière et cie.出版社,1878年],第26页注)。这种混淆最明确的捍卫者,意味深长的是,是美国左翼主义的主要哲学家约翰·杜威,根据他的说法,"自由是做具体事情的有效权力",因此"对自由的要求就是对权力的要求"。参见约翰·杜威,《自由与社会控制》,《社会前沿》第2卷,1935年11月,第41页。

[注-原-5] 马克斯·伊斯特曼,《斯大林的俄国与社会主义危机》(纽约:W. W. Norton出版社,1940年),引文分别见第82页、第82页和第154页。哈耶克最初将引文都列为出现在第82页。美国人马克斯·伊斯特曼(1883-1969)是激进刊物《群众》的编辑和出版人。俄国革命后他前往苏联并娶了一位俄国女性。到1930年代,他对苏联实验感到幻灭,认为列宁革命的初衷被斯大林颠覆了。如我在导言中所述,伊斯特曼为《读者文摘》浓缩了《通往奴役之路》。

[注-原-6] W. H. 张伯林,《集体主义:一个虚假的乌托邦》(纽约:Macmillan出版社,1937年),第202-203页。作家和记者威廉·亨利·张伯林(1897-1969)于1922年作为《基督教科学箴言报》记者前往莫斯科。尽管最初同情革命事业,但他很快对斯大林主义感到幻灭。

[注-原-7] F. A. 沃伊特,《归于凯撒》(纽约:G. P. Putnam's Sons出版社,1938年),第95页。英国记者和作家弗雷德里克·奥古斯都·沃伊特(1892-1957)在两次世界大战之间担任《曼彻斯特卫报》驻柏林记者。我无法在沃伊特的书中找到引用的段落,尽管以下几行,摘自第35页,表达了类似的情感:"马克思主义只是一个历史兴趣的现象,因为它甚至在其主要据点也失败了,如果不是它与国家社会主义如此密切相关的话。没有马克思主义,国家社会主义是不可想象的。"沃伊特在他的书中指出了马克思主义与国家社会主义之间以及列宁与希特勒之间的相似之处。

[注-原-8] 沃尔特·李普曼,《后代的政府》,《大西洋月刊》第158卷,1936年11月,第552页。美国记者、作家和社会评论家沃尔特·李普曼(1889-1974)为《纽约先驱论坛报》撰稿。他于1962年获得普利策国际报道奖。

[注-原-9] 彼得·德鲁克,《经济人的终结:新极权主义研究》(纽约:The John Day Co.出版社,1939年),第245-246页。在原文中,哈耶克错误地将引文所在页码列为第230页。维也纳出生的美国管理顾问彼得·德鲁克(1909-2005)在本宁顿学院和纽约大学任教,之后被任命为加利福尼亚州克莱蒙特研究生院(现克莱蒙特研究生大学)社会科学教授。

[注-原-10] 关于许多法西斯领导人思想历程的启发性描述,可见于罗伯特·米歇尔斯(他本人是前马克思主义法西斯主义者),《社会主义与法西斯主义作为意大利的政治潮流:历史研究》第2卷,《意大利的社会主义与法西斯主义》(慕尼黑:Meyer and Jessen出版社,1925年),第264-66页,第311-12页。

[注-原-11] 法国政治家皮埃尔·拉瓦尔(1883-1945)在维希政权期间担任贝当元帅的副手,随后担任总理。解放后他作为通敌者被处决。挪威外交官维德孔·吉斯林(1887-1945)于1933年成立了以德国国家社会主义党为模板的民族团结党,并在占领期间担任傀儡总理。他的名字已成为通敌的同义词。吉斯林在战争结束时被审判并处决。

[注-原-12] 爱德华·海曼,《自由主义的重新发现》,《社会研究》第8卷,1941年11月,第479页。值得在此回忆的是,无论出于什么原因,希特勒认为在1941年2月的一次公开演讲中宣称"基本上国家社会主义和马克思主义是一样的"是权宜之计。参见文章《希特勒先生2月24日的演讲》,《国际新闻公报》(由皇家国际事务研究所出版)第18卷,1941年3月8日,第269页。爱德华·海曼(1889-1967)从1925年到1933年在汉堡大学任教,1933年逃离德国,在纽约社会研究新学院任职。

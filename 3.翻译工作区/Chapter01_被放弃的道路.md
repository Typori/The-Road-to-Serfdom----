## 第一节:历史岔路——十九世纪自由主义的兴衰

[原文]
> When the course of civilization takes an unexpected turn—when, instead of the continuous progress which we have come to expect, we find ourselves threatened by evils associated by us with past ages of barbarism—we naturally blame anything but ourselves. <!-- p1.s1 -->

[译文]
当文明的进程意外转折——当我们不再如往常般期待着持续的进步,而是发现自己正被那些与"野蛮时代"相连的恶兆所威胁——我们本能地把责任归咎于别人,而不是自己。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> Have we not all striven according to our best lights, and have not many of our finest minds incessantly worked to make this a better world? Have not all our efforts and hopes been directed toward greater freedom, justice, and prosperity? <!-- p1.s2 -->

[译文]
我们难道不是都在按照自己最好的见识努力着吗?我们当中许多最优秀的头脑难道不是在不懈地工作,要让这个世界变得更好吗?我们所有的努力和希望,难道不都指向更大的自由、正义与繁荣吗?<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> If the outcome is so different from our aims—if, instead of freedom and prosperity, bondage and misery stare us in the face—is it not clear that sinister forces must have foiled our intentions, that we are the victims of some evil power which must be conquered before we can resume the road to better things? <!-- p1.s3 -->

[译文]
既然结果与我们的目标如此不同——既然我们面对的不是自由与繁荣,而是奴役与苦难——那么显而易见的是:一定有某种邪恶力量挫败了我们的意图。我们是某种恶势力的受害者。在我们能够重新走上通往美好事物的道路之前,必须先征服这股恶势力。<!-- p1.s3 -->

[原文]
> However much we may differ when we name the culprit—whether it is the wicked capitalist or the vicious spirit of a particular nation, the stupidity of our elders, or a social system not yet, although we have struggled against it for half a century, fully overthrown—we all are, or at last were until recently, certain of one thing: that the leading ideas which during the last generation have become common to most people of good will and have determined the major changes in our social life cannot have been wrong. <!-- p1.s4 -->

[译文]
尽管我们在指认罪魁祸首时意见各异——有人说是邪恶的资本家,有人说是某个特定民族的恶毒精神,有人说是我们长辈的愚蠢,还有人说是一个我们已经斗争了半个世纪却仍未彻底推翻的社会制度——但我们所有人,或者至少直到最近还都确信一点:过去这一代人中,那些已经成为大多数善良人士共识的主导思想,那些决定了我们社会生活重大变革的思想,不可能是错的。<!-- p1.s4 -->

[原文]
> We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis of our civilization except one: that the present state of the world may be the result of genuine error on our own part and that the pursuit of some of our most cherished ideals has apparently produced results utterly different from those which we expected. <!-- p1.s5 -->

[译文]
对于我们文明当前的危机,我们愿意接受几乎任何解释——除了一个:现在世界的状况,可能正是我们自己真真切切犯下的错误所导致的。我们对某些最珍视的理想的追求,显然产生了与我们预期完全不同的结果。<!-- p1.s5 -->

[原文]
> While all our energies are directed to bring this war to a victorious conclusion, it is sometimes difficult to remember that even before the war the values for which we are now fighting were threatened here and destroyed elsewhere. <!-- p2.s1 -->

[译文]
当我们所有精力都集中于将这场战争带向胜利的结局时,有时我们很难记起:即便在战前,我们现在为之战斗的价值观,就已经在这里受到威胁,在别处遭到摧毁。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> Though for the time being the different ideals are represented by hostile nations fighting for their existence, we must not forget that this conflict has grown out of a struggle of ideas within what, not so long ago, was a common European civilization and that the tendencies which have culminated in the creation of the totalitarian systems were not confined to the countries which have succumbed to them. <!-- p2.s2 -->

[译文]
虽然眼下这些不同的理想是由那些为生存而战的敌对国家所代表,但我们不能忘记一个事实。这场冲突,是从一场思想斗争中生长出来的。而这场思想斗争,发生在不久前还是共同的欧洲文明内部。那些最终导致极权主义体制诞生的趋势,并不仅仅局限于已经屈服于它们的那些国家。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> Though the first task must now be to win the war, to win it will only gain us another opportunity to face the basic problems and to find a way of averting the fate which has overtaken kindred civilizations. <!-- p2.s3 -->

[译文]
尽管首要任务现在必须是赢得战争,但赢得战争只会为我们争取到另一次机会——去面对那些根本问题,去找到一条避免我们遭受与相似文明同样命运的道路。<!-- p2.s3 -->

[原文]
> Now, it is somewhat difficult to think of Germany and Italy, or of Russia, not as different worlds but as products of a development of thought in which we have shared; it is, at least so far as our enemies are concerned, easier and more comforting to think that they are entirely different from us and that what happened there cannot happen here. <!-- p3.s1 -->

[译文]
现在,要把德国、意大利,或者俄国,不看作是不同的世界,而看作是我们共同参与的思想发展的产物,这确实有些困难。至少就我们的敌人而言,更容易、也更让人安心的做法是认为:他们与我们完全不同,那里发生的事不可能在这里发生。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> Yet the history of these countries in the years before the rise of the totalitarian system showed few features with which we are not familiar. The external conflict is a result of a transformation of European thought in which others have moved so much faster as to bring them into irreconcilable conflict with our ideals, but which has not left us unaffected. <!-- p3.s2 -->

[译文]
然而,这些国家在极权主义体制兴起之前那些年的历史,几乎没有什么特征是我们不熟悉的。当前的外部冲突,是欧洲思想转型的一个结果。在这场转型中,其他人走得快得多,以至于他们与我们的理想产生了不可调和的冲突。但这场转型,也并非没有影响到我们。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> That a change of ideas and the force of human will have made the world what it is now, though men did not foresee the results, and that no spontaneous change in the facts obliged us thus to adapt our thought is perhaps particularly difficult for the Anglo-Saxon nations to see, just because in this development they have, fortunately for them, lagged behind most of the European peoples. <!-- p3.s3 -->

[译文]
有一个事实对盎格鲁-撒克逊国家来说尤其难以看清:现今世界的样貌乃是观念转变与人的意志之力所塑造,虽然人们并未预见这些后果,也并非客观形势的自发变化迫使我们改变思想,而是我们主动接纳了新的观念,才导致了如今的局面。之所以这一点对盎格鲁-撒克逊国家特别难以理解,正是因为幸运的是,他们在这场发展中落后于欧洲大多数民族。<!-- p3.s3 -->

[原文]
> We still think of the ideals which guide us, and have guided us for the past generation, as ideals only to be realized in the future and are not aware how far in the last twenty-five years they have already transformed not only the world but also our own countries. <!-- p3.s4 -->

[译文]
我们仍然认为,那些指引着我们、在过去这一代人中一直指引着我们的理想,只是有待在未来实现的理想。我们没有意识到,在过去二十五年里,这些理想已经在多大程度上改变了世界,也改变了我们自己的国家。<!-- p3.s4 -->

[原文]
> We still believe that until quite recently we were governed by what are vaguely called nineteenth-century ideas or the principle of laissez faire. Compared with some other countries, and from the point of view of those impatient to speed up the change, there may be some justification for such belief. <!-- p3.s5 -->

[译文]
我们仍然相信,直到最近,我们还是被那些模糊地称为"十九世纪思想"或"自由放任原则"的东西所治理。与其他一些国家相比,从那些急于加快变革的人的角度来看,这种信念或许有些道理。<!-- p3.s5 -->

[原文]
> But although until 1931 England and America had followed only slowly on the path on which others had led, even by then they had moved so far that only those whose memory goes back to the years before the last war know what a liberal world has been like. <!-- p3.s6 -->

[译文]
但是,尽管直到1931年,英国和美国还只是缓慢地跟随着别人引领的道路,即便到那时,它们也已经走得很远了。只有那些记忆能够回溯到上次大战之前岁月的人,才知道一个自由主义的世界曾经是什么样子。[注-原-2]<!-- p3.s6 -->

[原文]
> The crucial point of which our people are still so little aware is, however, not merely the magnitude of the changes which have taken place during the last generation but the fact that they mean a complete change in the direction of the evolution of our ideas and social order. <!-- p4.s1 -->

[译文]
然而,我们的人民至今仍然几乎没有意识到的关键之处,不仅仅是过去这一代人中发生的变化之巨大,而是这样一个事实:这些变化意味着我们思想与社会秩序演化方向的彻底改变。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> For at least twenty-five years before the specter of totalitarianism became a real threat, we had progressively been moving away from the basic ideas on which Western civilization has been built. <!-- p4.s2 -->

[译文]
至少在极权主义的幽灵成为真正威胁的二十五年之前,我们就已经在逐渐远离西方文明赖以建立的那些基本思想。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> That this movement on which we have entered with such high hopes and ambitions should have brought us face to face with the totalitarian horror has come as a profound shock to this generation, which still refuses to connect the two facts. <!-- p4.s3 -->

[译文]
我们曾怀着如此高的希望和雄心踏上这条道路。这条道路却让我们与极权主义的恐怖迎面相遇。这对这一代人来说是一个深刻的震撼。而这一代人至今仍拒绝把这两个事实联系起来。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> Yet this development merely confirms the warnings of the fathers of the liberal philosophy which we still profess. We have progressively abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which personal and political freedom has never existed in the past. <!-- p4.s4 -->

[译文]
然而,这种发展只不过证实了自由主义哲学先驱们的警告——我们至今仍声称信奉这一哲学。我们已经逐步放弃了经济事务中的那种自由。而在过去,没有这种自由,个人自由与政治自由就从未存在过。<!-- p4.s4 -->

[原文]
> Although we had been warned by some of the greatest political thinkers of the nineteenth century, by Tocqueville and Lord Acton, that socialism means slavery, we have steadily moved in the direction of socialism. And now that we have seen a new form of slavery arise before our eyes, we have so completely forgotten the warning that it scarcely occurs to us that the two things may be connected. <!-- p4.s5 -->

[译文]
尽管十九世纪一些最伟大的政治思想家,托克维尔和阿克顿勋爵,曾警告我们社会主义意味着奴役,我们还是坚定不移地朝着社会主义的方向前进。[注-原-3] 如今,当我们亲眼看到一种新的奴役形式在我们面前兴起时,我们已经如此彻底地忘记了那个警告,以至于几乎想不到这两件事可能是有联系的。[注-原-4]<!-- p4.s5 -->

[原文]
> How sharp a break not only with the recent past but with the whole evolution of Western civilization the modern trend toward socialism means becomes clear if we consider it not merely against the background of the nineteenth century but in a longer historical perspective. <!-- p5.s1 -->

[译文]
如果我们不仅仅以十九世纪为背景,而是从更长远的历史视角来审视,就会清楚地看到:现代走向社会主义的趋势,不仅与最近的过去,而且与西方文明的整个演化过程,构成了多么剧烈的断裂。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> We are rapidly abandoning not the views merely of Cobden and Bright, of Adam Smith and Hume, or even of Locke and Milton, but one of the salient characteristics of Western civilization as it has grown from the foundations laid by Christianity and the Greeks and Romans. <!-- p5.s2 -->

[译文]
我们正在迅速抛弃的,不仅仅是科布登和布赖特的观点,不仅仅是亚当·斯密和休谟的观点,甚至不仅仅是洛克和弥尔顿的观点。[注-原-5] 我们正在抛弃的,是西方文明的一个显著特征——这个特征从基督教以及希腊罗马人奠定的基础上生长出来。<!-- p5.s2 -->

[原文]
> Not merely nineteenth- and eighteenth-century liberalism, but the basic individualism inherited by us from Erasmus and Montaigne, from Cicero and Tacitus, Pericles and Thucydides, is progressively relinquished. <!-- p5.s3 -->

[译文]
我们正在逐步放弃的,不仅是十九世纪和十八世纪的自由主义,而且是我们从伊拉斯谟和蒙田、从西塞罗和塔西佗、从伯里克利和修昔底德那里继承下来的基本个人主义。[注-原-6]<!-- p5.s3 -->

[原文]
> The Nazi leader who described the National Socialist revolution as a counter-Renaissance spoke more truly than he probably knew. It was the decisive step in the destruction of that civilization which modern man had built up from the age of the Renaissance and which was, above all, an individualist civilization. <!-- p6.s1 -->

[译文]
有一位纳粹领袖曾把国家社会主义革命描述为"反文艺复兴"。他说的比他自己大概知道的更为真实。这是摧毁现代人从文艺复兴时代开始建立起来的文明的决定性一步。而那个文明,首先是一个个人主义的文明。<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> Individualism has a bad name today, and the term has come to be connected with egotism and selfishness. But the individualism of which we speak in contrast to socialism and all other forms of collectivism has no necessary connection with these. <!-- p6.s2 -->

[译文]
个人主义在今天名声不好,这个词已经与自私自利联系在一起了。但我们所说的个人主义——与社会主义和所有其他形式的集体主义相对的个人主义——与自私自利没有必然联系。[注-原-7]<!-- p6.s2 -->

[原文]
> Only gradually in the course of this book shall we be able to make clear the contrast between the two opposing principles. But the essential features of that individualism which, from elements provided by Christianity and the philosophy of classical antiquity, was first fully developed during the Renaissance and has since grown and spread into what we know as Western civilization—are the respect for the individual man qua man, that is, the recognition of his own views and tastes as supreme in his own sphere, however narrowly that may be circumscribed, and the belief that it is desirable that men should develop their own individual gifts and bents. <!-- p6.s3 -->

[译文]
只有在本书的逐步展开中,我们才能把这两个对立原则之间的对比阐述清楚。但那种个人主义的基本特征可以概括如下。这种个人主义,从基督教和古典哲学提供的元素出发,在文艺复兴期间首次得到充分发展,此后成长并传播为我们所知的西方文明。它的基本特征是:对作为人的个体的尊重——也就是说,承认他自己的观点和品味在他自己的领域内是至高无上的,无论这个领域可能被限定得多么狭窄。以及这样一种信念:人们应当发展他们自己独特的天赋和才能,这是值得追求的。<!-- p6.s3 -->

[原文]
> "Freedom" and "liberty" are now words so worn with use and abuse that one must hesitate to employ them to express the ideals for which they stood during that period. "Tolerance" is, perhaps, the only word which still preserves the full meaning of the principle which during the whole of this period was in the ascendant and which only in recent times has again been in decline, to disappear completely with the rise of the totalitarian state. <!-- p6.s4 -->

[译文]
"自由"(freedom)和"自由"(liberty)现在已经是被使用和滥用得太过的词汇,以至于人们必须犹豫是否要用它们来表达在那个时期它们所代表的理想。"宽容"(tolerance)或许是唯一一个词,仍然完整保留着那个原则的全部含义——这个原则在整个那个时期都在上升,只是到了最近才再次衰落,并随着极权主义国家的兴起而彻底消失。<!-- p6.s4 -->

## 第二节:商业自由与文明的演进

[原文]
> The gradual transformation of a rigidly organized hierarchic system into one where men could at least attempt to shape their own life, where man gained the opportunity of knowing and choosing between different forms of life, is closely associated with the growth of commerce. <!-- p7.s1 -->

[译文]
商业的发展推动了一场深刻的社会变革:刚性的等级组织体系逐步瓦解,人们获得了塑造自己人生的机会,可以认识和选择不同的生活方式。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> From the commercial cities of northern Italy the new view of life spread with commerce to the west and north, through France and the southwest of Germany to the Low Countries and the British Isles, taking firm root wherever there was no despotic political power to stifle it. <!-- p7.s2 -->

[译文]
从意大利北部的商业城市,这种新的生活观念随着商业向西向北传播,经由法国和德国西南部到达低地国家和不列颠群岛,在没有专制政治权力扼杀它的地方牢牢扎根。<!-- p7.s2 -->

[原文]
> In the Low Countries and Britain it for a long time enjoyed its fullest development and for the first time had an opportunity to grow freely and to become the foundation of the social and political life of these countries. <!-- p7.s3 -->

[译文]
在低地国家和英国,它长期享有最充分的发展,并第一次有机会自由生长,成为这些国家社会和政治生活的基础。<!-- p7.s3 -->

[原文]
> And it was from there that in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it again began to spread in a more fully developed form to the West and East, to the New World and to the center of the European continent, where devastating wars and political oppression had largely submerged the earlier beginnings of a similar growth. <!-- p7.s4 -->

[译文]
正是从那里,在十七世纪末和十八世纪,它以更加完整的形态再次开始向西向东传播,传向新世界,传向欧洲大陆中部——在那里,毁灭性的战争和政治压迫已经在很大程度上淹没了类似发展的早期萌芽。[注-原-8]<!-- p7.s4 -->

[原文]
> During the whole of this modern period of European history the general direction of social development was one of freeing the individual from the ties which had bound him to the customary or prescribed ways in the pursuit of his ordinary activities. <!-- p8.s1 -->

[译文]
在欧洲历史的整个现代时期,社会发展的总体方向是将个人从束缚他的那些纽带中解放出来——这些纽带曾使他在追求日常活动时不得不遵循习俗或规定的方式。<!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> The conscious realization that the spontaneous and uncontrolled efforts of individuals were capable of producing a complex order of economic activities could come only after this development had made some progress. <!-- p8.s2 -->

[译文]
人们只有在经济活动发展到一定阶段后,才能清楚地认识到:个人的自发行动虽然不受控制,却能够创造出复杂有序的经济活动体系。<!-- p8.s2 -->

[原文]
> The subsequent elaboration of a consistent argument in favor of economic freedom was the outcome of a free growth of economic activity which had been the undesigned and unforeseen by-product of political freedom. <!-- p8.s3 -->

[译文]
支持经济自由的理论后来得到系统的论证,但这个论证本身却是经济活动自由发展的产物——而这种自由发展原本是政治自由的意外收获,并非有意设计的结果。<!-- p8.s3 -->

[原文]
> Perhaps the greatest result of the unchaining of individual energies was the marvelous growth of science which followed the march of individual liberty from Italy to England and beyond. <!-- p9.s1 -->

[译文]
也许释放个人能量的最伟大成果,是科学的惊人发展——它跟随着个人自由从意大利向英国及更远地方的进军。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> That the inventive faculty of man had been no less in earlier periods is shown by the many highly ingenious automatic toys and other mechanical contrivances constructed while industrial technique still remained stationary and by the development in some industries which, like mining or watch-making, were not subject to restrictive controls. <!-- p9.s2 -->

[译文]
在更早的时期,人的创造才能并不更少,这一点可以从许多高度精巧的自动玩具和其他机械装置中看出——这些装置是在工业技术仍然停滞不前时建造的。还可以从某些不受限制性管制的行业(如采矿或钟表制造)的发展中看出。<!-- p9.s2 -->

[原文]
> But the few attempts toward a more extended industrial use of mechanical inventions, some extraordinarily advanced, were promptly suppressed, and the desire for knowledge was stifled, so long as the dominant views were held to be binding for all: the beliefs of the great majority on what was right and proper were allowed to bar the way of the individual innovator. <!-- p9.s3 -->

[译文]
但那些试图更广泛地在工业上运用机械发明的尝试——其中有些异常先进——都被迅速压制了,对知识的渴望也被扼杀了。只要占主导地位的观点被认为对所有人都有约束力,大多数人关于什么是正确和恰当的信念就被用来阻挡个体创新者的道路。<!-- p9.s3 -->

[原文]
> Only since industrial freedom opened the path to the free use of new knowledge, only since everything could be tried—if somebody could be found to back it at his own risk—and, it should be added, as often as not from outside the authorities officially entrusted with the cultivation of learning, has science made the great strides which in the last hundred and fifty years have changed the face of the world. <!-- p9.s4 -->

[译文]
只有在工业自由开辟了自由运用新知识的道路之后,只有在一切都可以尝试——只要能找到愿意自担风险支持它的人——并且,应当补充的是,往往是来自官方被委以培育学问之责的权威机构之外,科学才取得了在过去一百五十年里改变了世界面貌的巨大进步。<!-- p9.s4 -->

[原文]
> As is so often true, the nature of our civilization has been seen more clearly by its enemies than by most of its friends: "the perennial Western malady, the revolt of the individual against the species," as that nineteenth-century totalitarian, Auguste Comte, has described it, was indeed the force which built our civilization. <!-- p10.s1 -->

[译文]
正如经常出现的情况一样,我们文明的本质被它的敌人看得比它的大多数朋友更清楚:那位十九世纪的极权主义者奥古斯特·孔德所描述的"西方的永恒痼疾,个人对群体的反叛",确实正是建立我们文明的力量。[注-原-9]<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> What the nineteenth century added to the individualism of the preceding period was merely to make all classes conscious of freedom, to develop systematically and continuously what had grown in a haphazard and patchy manner, and to spread it from England and Holland over most of the European continent. <!-- p10.s2 -->

[译文]
十九世纪对前一时期个人主义的补充,仅仅是让所有阶级都意识到自由,系统而持续地发展那些以零散和不完整方式生长出来的东西,并将它从英国和荷兰传播到欧洲大陆的大部分地区。<!-- p10.s2 -->

[原文]
> The result of this growth surpassed all expectations. <!-- p11.s1 -->

[译文]
这种发展的结果超出了所有预期。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> Wherever the barriers to the free exercise of human ingenuity were removed, man became rapidly able to satisfy ever widening ranges of desire. <!-- p11.s2 -->

[译文]
无论在哪里,只要人类才智的自由发挥的障碍被移除,人们就迅速能够满足越来越广泛的欲望范围。<!-- p11.s2 -->

[原文]
> And while the rising standard soon led to the discovery of very dark spots in society, spots which men were no longer willing to tolerate, there was probably no class that did not substantially benefit from the general advance. <!-- p11.s3 -->

[译文]
尽管不断提高的生活水平很快导致人们发现了社会中非常黑暗的角落——人们不再愿意容忍这些角落——但大概没有哪个阶级没有从总体进步中实质性受益。<!-- p11.s3 -->

[原文]
> We cannot do justice to this astonishing growth if we measure it by our present standards, which themselves result from this growth and now make many defects obvious. <!-- p11.s4 -->

[译文]
如果我们用现在的标准来衡量这种惊人的发展,我们就无法公正地评价它,因为我们现在的标准本身就是这种发展的结果,现在使许多缺陷变得显而易见。<!-- p11.s4 -->

[原文]
> To appreciate what it meant to those who took part in it, we must measure it by the hopes and wishes men held when it began: and there can be no doubt that its success surpassed man's wildest dreams, that by the beginning of the twentieth century the workingman in the Western world had reached a degree of material comfort, security, and personal independence which a hundred years before had seemed scarcely possible. <!-- p11.s5 -->

[译文]
要理解它对那些参与其中的人意味着什么,我们必须用人们在它开始时所怀有的希望和愿望来衡量:毫无疑问,它的成功超出了人类最狂野的梦想。到二十世纪初,西方世界的工人已经达到了物质舒适、安全和个人独立的程度,而这在一百年前似乎几乎是不可能的。<!-- p11.s5 -->

## 第三节:成功带来的雄心与自由主义的危机

[原文]
> What in the future will probably appear the most significant and far-reaching effect of this success is the new sense of power over their own fate, the belief in the unbounded possibilities of improving their own lot, which the success already achieved created among men. <!-- p12.s1 -->

[译文]
在未来看来,这种成功最重大和影响最深远的效应,可能是人们对自己命运的新的掌控感,是对改善自己处境的无限可能性的信念——这种信念是已经取得的成功在人们心中创造出来的。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> With the success grew ambition—and man had every right to be ambitious. <!-- p12.s2 -->

[译文]
随着成功而来的是雄心——人有充分的理由雄心勃勃。<!-- p12.s2 -->

[原文]
> What had been an inspiring promise seemed no longer enough, the rate of progress far too slow; and the principles which had made this progress possible in the past came to be regarded more as obstacles to speedier progress, impatiently to be brushed away, than as the conditions for the preservation and development of what had already been achieved. <!-- p12.s3 -->

[译文]
曾经鼓舞人心的承诺似乎不再够了,进步的速度似乎太慢了。那些在过去使这种进步成为可能的原则,越来越被视为加快进步的障碍——需要不耐烦地将其扫除——而不是被视为保存和发展已经取得成就的条件。<!-- p12.s3 -->

[原文]
> There is nothing in the basic principles of liberalism to make it a stationary creed; there are no hard-and-fast rules fixed once and for all. <!-- p13.s1 -->

[译文]
自由主义的基本原则中没有任何东西使它成为一个停滞不前的信条。没有一劳永逸地固定下来的硬性规则。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> The fundamental principle that in the ordering of our affairs we should make as much use as possible of the spontaneous forces of society, and resort as little as possible to coercion, is capable of an infinite variety of applications. <!-- p13.s2 -->

[译文]
基本原则是:在安排我们的事务时,我们应该尽可能多地利用社会的自发力量,尽可能少地诉诸强制。这个原则能够以无限多样的方式应用。<!-- p13.s2 -->

[原文]
> There is, in particular, all the difference between deliberately creating a system within which competition will work as beneficially as possible and passively accepting institutions as they are. <!-- p13.s3 -->

[译文]
特别是,刻意创造一个能让竞争尽可能有益地运作的制度,与被动接受现存的制度,这两者之间有着天壤之别。<!-- p13.s3 -->

[原文]
> Probably nothing has done so much harm to the liberal cause as the wooden insistence of some liberals on certain rough rules of thumb, above all the principle of laissez faire. <!-- p13.s4 -->

[译文]
也许没有什么比某些自由主义者对某些粗略经验法则的僵化坚持更伤害自由主义事业了,尤其是对自由放任原则的坚持。<!-- p13.s4 -->

[原文]
> Yet, in a sense, this was necessary and unavoidable. <!-- p13.s5 -->

[译文]
然而,从某种意义上说,这是必要的,也是不可避免的。<!-- p13.s5 -->

[原文]
> Against the innumerable interests which could show that particular measures would confer immediate and obvious benefits on some, while the harm they caused was much more indirect and difficult to see, nothing short of some hard-and-fast rule would have been effective. <!-- p13.s6 -->

[译文]
面对无数既得利益者——他们能够表明特定措施会给某些人带来即时而明显的好处,而这些措施造成的伤害却要间接得多、难以看清——除了某种硬性规则之外,什么都不会有效。<!-- p13.s6 -->

[原文]
> And since a strong presumption in favor of industrial liberty had undoubtedly been established, the temptation to present it as a rule which knew no exceptions was too strong always to be resisted. <!-- p13.s7 -->

[译文]
既然支持工业自由的强烈推定无疑已经确立,将它呈现为一个不容例外的规则的诱惑,就太强烈以至于难以抗拒。<!-- p13.s7 -->

[原文]
> But, with this attitude taken by many popularizers of the liberal doctrine, it was almost inevitable that, once their position was penetrated at some points, it should soon collapse as a whole. <!-- p14.s1 -->

[译文]
但是,许多自由主义学说的通俗化者采取了这种态度,几乎不可避免地,一旦他们的阵地在某些点被攻破,整个阵地就会很快崩溃。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> The position was further weakened by the inevitably slow progress of a policy which aimed at a gradual improvement of the institutional framework of a free society. <!-- p14.s2 -->

[译文]
这种立场进一步被削弱,因为一项旨在逐步改善自由社会制度框架的政策,其进展不可避免地缓慢。<!-- p14.s2 -->

[原文]
> This progress depended on the growth of our understanding of the social forces and the conditions most favorable to their working in a desirable manner. <!-- p14.s3 -->

[译文]
因为这种进步的前提是我们对社会力量及其最优运作条件的理解不断深化。<!-- p14.s3 -->

[原文]
> Since the task was to assist, and where necessary to supplement, their operation, the first requisite was to understand them. <!-- p14.s4 -->

[译文]
既然任务是协助、并在必要时补充这些力量的作用,最首要的就是理解它们。<!-- p14.s4 -->

[原文]
> The attitude of the liberal toward society is like that of the gardener who tends a plant and, in order to create the conditions most favorable to its growth, must know as much as possible about its structure and the way it functions. <!-- p14.s5 -->

[译文]
自由主义者对社会的态度,就像园丁对植物的态度——为了创造最有利于其生长的条件,他必须尽可能多地了解它的结构和运作方式。<!-- p14.s5 -->

[原文]
> No sensible person should have doubted that the crude rules in which the principles of economic policy of the nineteenth century were expressed were only a beginning—that we had yet much to learn and that there were still immense possibilities of advancement on the lines on which we had moved. <!-- p15.s1 -->

[译文]
没有明智的人应该怀疑,表达十九世纪经济政策原则的那些粗糙规则只是一个开端——我们还有很多要学习的东西,在我们已经前进的路线上仍然有巨大的进步可能性。<!-- p15.s1 -->

[原文]
> But this advance could come only as we gained increasing intellectual mastery of the forces of which we had to make use. <!-- p15.s2 -->

[译文]
但这种进步只有在我们对必须利用的那些力量获得日益增长的智识掌握时才能到来。<!-- p15.s2 -->

[原文]
> There were many obvious tasks, such as our handling of the monetary system and the prevention or control of monopoly, and an even greater number of less obvious but hardly less important tasks to be undertaken in other fields, where there could be no doubt that the governments possessed enormous powers for good and evil; and there was every reason to expect that, with a better understanding of the problems, we should some day be able to use these powers successfully. <!-- p15.s3 -->

[译文]
有许多明显的任务,例如我们对货币体系的处理、对垄断的防止或控制,还有更多在其他领域不那么明显但几乎同样重要的任务需要承担。在这些领域,毫无疑问政府拥有巨大的为善或为恶的权力。我们有充分理由期待,随着对这些问题更好的理解,总有一天我们能够成功地使用这些权力。<!-- p15.s3 -->

[原文]
> But while the progress toward what is commonly called "positive" action was necessarily slow, and while for the immediate improvement liberalism had to rely largely on the gradual increase of wealth which freedom brought about, it had constantly to fight proposals which threatened this progress. <!-- p16.s1 -->

[译文]
但是,尽管朝着通常所说的"积极"行动的进步必然缓慢,尽管为了立即改善,自由主义不得不主要依靠自由带来的财富的逐步增长,它却必须不断对抗威胁这种进步的提议。<!-- p16.s1 -->

[原文]
> It came to be regarded as a "negative" creed because it could offer to particular individuals little more than a share in the common progress—a progress which came to be taken more and more for granted and was no longer recognized as the result of the policy of freedom. <!-- p16.s2 -->

[译文]
它开始被视为一种"消极"的信条,因为它能给特定个人提供的,不过是在共同进步中的一份——而这种进步越来越被视为理所当然,不再被认为是自由政策的结果。<!-- p16.s2 -->

[原文]
> It might even be said that the very success of liberalism became the cause of its decline. <!-- p16.s3 -->

[译文]
甚至可以说,正是自由主义的成功成为了它衰落的原因。<!-- p16.s3 -->

[原文]
> Because of the success already achieved, man became increasingly unwilling to tolerate the evils still with him which now appeared both unbearable and unnecessary. <!-- p16.s4 -->

[译文]
因为已经取得的成功,人们越来越不愿意容忍仍然存在的那些恶——这些恶现在看来既是无法忍受的,也是不必要的。[注-原-10]<!-- p16.s4 -->

## 第四节:从自由主义到社会主义的转变

[原文]
> Because of the growing impatience with the slow advance of liberal policy, the just irritation with those who used liberal phraseology in defense of antisocial privileges, and the boundless ambition seemingly justified by the material improvements already achieved, it came to pass that toward the turn of the century the belief in the basic tenets of liberalism was more and more relinquished. <!-- p17.s1 -->

[译文]
到世纪之交时,人们对自由主义基本信条的信仰越来越淡薄了。这有三个原因。第一,人们对自由主义政策的缓慢进展日益不耐烦。第二,有些人用自由主义的辞藻为反社会的特权辩护,这引起了正当的恼怒。第三,已经取得的物质改善似乎证明了无限雄心是正当的。<!-- p17.s1 -->

[原文]
> What had been achieved came to be regarded as a secure and imperishable possession, acquired once and for all. <!-- p17.s2 -->

[译文]
人们开始把已经取得的成就视为理所当然。他们认为这是一种安全而永久的财产,已经一劳永逸地获得了。<!-- p17.s2 -->

[原文]
> The eyes of the people became fixed on the new demands, the rapid satisfaction of which seemed to be barred by the adherence to the old principles. <!-- p17.s3 -->

[译文]
人们的目光转向了新的诉求。在他们看来,坚持旧原则阻碍了这些诉求的快速满足。<!-- p17.s3 -->

[原文]
> It became more and more widely accepted that further advance could be expected not along the old lines within the general framework which had made past progress possible but only by a complete remodeling of society. <!-- p17.s4 -->

[译文]
一种观点越来越被广泛接受:要想取得更多的进步,就不能再沿着旧路线前进了。那个使过去进步成为可能的总体框架已经不够用了,只有彻底改造社会才行。<!-- p17.s4 -->

[原文]
> It was no longer a question of adding to or improving the existing machinery but of completely scrapping and replacing it. <!-- p17.s5 -->

[译文]
问题不再是如何增补或改进现有的机制,而是要彻底废弃它,用新的来替换。<!-- p17.s5 -->

[原文]
> And, as the hope of the new generation came to be centered on something completely new, interest in and understanding of the functioning of the existing society rapidly declined; and, with the decline of the understanding of the way in which the free system worked, our awareness of what depended on its existence also decreased. <!-- p17.s6 -->

[译文]
新一代人把希望寄托在某种全新的东西上。因此,他们对现存社会如何运作的兴趣和理解迅速下降。随着人们越来越不理解自由制度是如何运作的,他们也越来越意识不到有什么东西依赖于这个制度的存在。<!-- p17.s6 -->

[原文]
> This is not the place to discuss how this change in outlook was fostered by the uncritical transfer to the problems of society of habits of thought engendered by the preoccupation with technological problems, the habits of thought of the natural scientist and the engineer, and how these at the same time tended to discredit the results of the past study of society which did not conform to their prejudices and to impose ideals of organization on a sphere to which they are not appropriate. <!-- p18.s1 -->

[译文]
至于这种观念转变是如何被助长的,这里不是讨论这个问题的地方。[注-原-11] 简单说就是,人们专注于技术问题,形成了自然科学家和工程师的思维习惯,然后不加批判地把这些思维习惯转移到社会问题上。这些思维习惯还产生了两个倾向:一是贬低过去的社会研究成果——只要它们不符合自己的偏见;二是把组织理想强加到一个并不适用的领域。这些也不是这里要讨论的。<!-- p18.s1 -->

[原文]
> All we are here concerned to show is how completely, though gradually and by almost imperceptible steps, our attitude toward society has changed. <!-- p18.s2 -->

[译文]
我们在这里只想说明一点:我们对社会的态度已经彻底改变了。尽管这种改变是逐渐发生的,每一步都几乎难以察觉。<!-- p18.s2 -->

[原文]
> What at every stage of this process of change had appeared a difference of degree only has in its cumulative effect already brought about a fundamental difference between the older liberal attitude toward society and the present approach to social problems. <!-- p18.s3 -->

[译文]
在变化过程的每个阶段,看起来只是程度上的差异。但这些差异累积起来,已经造成了根本性的不同。旧自由主义对待社会的态度,与当前处理社会问题的方法,已经有了本质区别。<!-- p18.s3 -->

[原文]
> The change amounts to a complete reversal of the trend we have sketched, an entire abandonment of the individualist tradition which has created Western civilization. <!-- p18.s4 -->

[译文]
这种变化意味着什么呢?它意味着我们前面勾勒的那个趋势完全逆转了。它意味着对个人主义传统的彻底放弃——而正是这个传统创造了西方文明。<!-- p18.s4 -->

[原文]
> According to the views now dominant, the question is no longer how we can make the best use of the spontaneous forces found in a free society. <!-- p19.s1 -->

[译文]
按照现在占主导地位的观点,问题已经不再是:我们如何才能最好地利用自由社会中的那些自发力量?<!-- p19.s1 -->

[原文]
> We have in effect undertaken to dispense with the forces which produced unforeseen results and to replace the impersonal and anonymous mechanism of the market by collective and "conscious" direction of all social forces to deliberately chosen goals. <!-- p19.s2 -->

[译文]
我们实际上已经着手做两件事。第一,摒弃那些会产生未预见结果的力量。第二,用集体的、"有意识的"指导来取代市场那种非人格化的、匿名的机制,把所有社会力量都引向刻意选定的目标。<!-- p19.s2 -->

[原文]
> The difference cannot be better illustrated than by the extreme position taken in a widely acclaimed book on whose program of so-called "planning for freedom" we shall have to comment yet more than once. <!-- p19.s3 -->

[译文]
这种差异有多大呢?没有什么比一本广受赞誉的书中的极端立场更能说明问题了。这本书提出了所谓"为自由而规划"的纲领,我们在后面还要不止一次地评论它。<!-- p19.s3 -->

[原文]
> "We have never had to set up and direct," writes Dr. Karl Mannheim, "the entire system of nature as we are forced to do today with society. . . . Mankind is tending more and more to regulate the whole of its social life, although it has never attempted to create a second nature." <!-- p19.s4 -->

[译文]
卡尔·曼海姆博士写道:"我们从来不必去建立和指导整个自然系统,但今天我们却被迫对社会这样做。……人类越来越倾向于调节其社会生活的全部,尽管它从未试图创造一个第二自然。"[注-原-12]<!-- p19.s4 -->

## 第五节:思想运动的地理逆转——从西向东

[原文]
> It is significant that this change in the trend of ideas has coincided with a reversal of the direction in which ideas have traveled in space. <!-- p20.s1 -->

[译文]
有一个现象值得注意:思想趋势的这种转变,恰好与思想传播方向的逆转同时发生。<!-- p20.s1 -->

[原文]
> For over two hundred years English ideas had been spreading eastward. <!-- p20.s2 -->

[译文]
两百多年来,英国的思想一直在向东传播。<!-- p20.s2 -->

[原文]
> The rule of freedom which had been achieved in England seemed destined to spread throughout the world. <!-- p20.s3 -->

[译文]
英国已经实现了自由的统治,这种统治似乎注定要传遍全世界。<!-- p20.s3 -->

[原文]
> By about 1870 the reign of these ideas had probably reached its easternmost expansion. <!-- p20.s4 -->

[译文]
到1870年左右,这些思想的统治可能已经达到了最东端的扩张。<!-- p20.s4 -->

[原文]
> From then onward it began to retreat, and a different set of ideas, not really new but very old, began to advance from the East. <!-- p20.s5 -->

[译文]
从那时起,它开始退却。与此同时,一套不同的思想开始从东方推进——这些思想并非真正新颖,而是非常古老。<!-- p20.s5 -->

[原文]
> England lost her intellectual leadership in the political and social sphere and became an importer of ideas. <!-- p20.s6 -->

[译文]
英国失去了在政治和社会领域的思想领导地位,变成了思想的进口国。<!-- p20.s6 -->

[原文]
> For the next sixty years Germany became the center from which the ideas destined to govern the world in the twentieth century spread east and west. <!-- p20.s7 -->

[译文]
在接下来的六十年里,德国成为新的中心。那些注定要在二十世纪统治世界的思想,从这里向东向西传播。<!-- p20.s7 -->

[原文]
> Whether it was Hegel or Marx, List or Schmoller, Sombart or Mannheim, whether it was socialism in its more radical form or merely "organization" or "planning" of a less radical kind, German ideas were everywhere readily imported and German institutions imitated. <!-- p20.s8 -->

[译文]
无论是黑格尔还是马克思,无论是李斯特还是施莫勒,无论是桑巴特还是曼海姆;无论是更激进形式的社会主义,还是不那么激进的"组织"或"规划"——德国思想到处都被轻易地引进,德国制度到处都被模仿。[注-原-13]<!-- p20.s8 -->

[原文]
> Although most of the new ideas, and particularly socialism, did not originate in Germany, it was in Germany that they were perfected and during the last quarter of the nineteenth and the first quarter of the twentieth century that they reached their fullest development. <!-- p21.s1 -->

[译文]
大多数新思想,特别是社会主义,并非起源于德国。但正是在德国,它们得到了完善。在十九世纪最后二十五年和二十世纪最初二十五年,它们在德国达到了最充分的发展。<!-- p21.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is now often forgotten how very considerable was the lead which Germany had during this period in the development of the theory and practice of socialism; that a generation before socialism became a serious issue in this country, Germany had a large socialist party in her parliament and that until not very long ago the doctrinal development of socialism was almost entirely carried on in Germany and Austria, so that even today Russian discussion largely carries on where the Germans left off. <!-- p21.s2 -->

[译文]
现在人们常常忘记,在这一时期,德国在社会主义理论和实践发展方面的领先程度有多大。几个事实可以说明这一点。第一,在社会主义成为英国的严重问题之前的一代人,德国议会中就已经有一个大型社会主义政党了。第二,直到不久之前,社会主义的学理发展几乎完全在德国和奥地利进行。第三,即使在今天,俄国的讨论在很大程度上也是从德国人停下的地方继续的。<!-- p21.s2 -->

[原文]
> Most English and American socialists are still unaware that the majority of the problems they begin to discover were thoroughly discussed by German socialists long ago. <!-- p21.s3 -->

[译文]
大多数英国和美国社会主义者仍然没有意识到:他们开始发现的大多数问题,早已被德国社会主义者彻底讨论过了。[注-原-14]<!-- p21.s3 -->

[原文]
> The intellectual influence which German thinkers were able to exercise during this period on the whole world was supported not merely by the great material progress of Germany but even more by the extraordinary reputation which German thinkers and scientists had earned during the preceding hundred years when Germany had once more become an integral and even leading member of the common European civilization. <!-- p22.s1 -->

[译文]
在这一时期,德国思想家能够对整个世界施加思想影响。这种影响力有两个支撑。一个是德国巨大的物质进步。另一个更重要的支撑,是德国思想家和科学家在前一个世纪赢得的非凡声誉——在那一个世纪里,德国再次成为共同的欧洲文明的完整成员,甚至是领导成员。<!-- p22.s1 -->

[原文]
> But it soon served to assist the spreading from Germany of ideas directed against the foundations of that civilization. <!-- p22.s2 -->

[译文]
但这种声誉很快被用来做另一件事:协助从德国传播那些针对欧洲文明基础的思想。<!-- p22.s2 -->

[原文]
> The Germans themselves—or at least those among them who spread these ideas—were fully aware of the conflict: what had been the common heritage of European civilization became to them, long before the Nazis, "Western" civilization—where "Western" was no longer used in the old sense of Occident but had come to mean west of the Rhine. <!-- p22.s3 -->

[译文]
德国人自己——或者至少是他们中间传播这些思想的那些人——完全意识到了这种冲突。在纳粹之前很久,他们就已经把曾经是欧洲文明共同遗产的东西称为"西方"文明了。这里的"西方"不再是旧意义上的西方(Occident),而是指莱茵河以西。<!-- p22.s3 -->

[原文]
> "Western" in this sense was liberalism and democracy, capitalism and individualism, free trade and any form of internationalism or love of peace. <!-- p22.s4 -->

[译文]
这个意义上的"西方"包括什么呢?包括自由主义和民主,包括资本主义和个人主义,包括自由贸易和任何形式的国际主义或对和平的热爱。<!-- p22.s4 -->

[原文]
> But in spite of the ill-concealed contempt of an ever increasing number of Germans for those "shallow" Western ideals, or perhaps because of it, the people of the West continued to import German ideas and were even induced to believe that their own former convictions had merely been rationalizations of selfish interests, that free trade was a doctrine invented to further British interests, and that the political ideals of England and America were hopelessly outmoded and a thing to be ashamed of. <!-- p22.s5 -->

[译文]
越来越多的德国人对那些"肤浅的"西方理想毫不掩饰地表示蔑视。然而,尽管如此,或者也许正是因为如此,西方人民继续进口德国思想。他们甚至被诱导相信:他们自己以前的信念,不过是自私利益的合理化;自由贸易,不过是为了推进英国利益而发明的学说;英国和美国的政治理想,已经绝望地过时了,是应当感到羞耻的东西。<!-- p22.s5 -->

## 注释

### 原注

[注-原-1] 富兰克林·D·罗斯福,《关于遏制垄断和经济权力集中的国会建议》,载《争取自由主义的持续斗争》,《富兰克林·D·罗斯福公共文件与演说集》第7卷(纽约:麦克米伦,1941年),第320页。该演说发表于1938年4月29日。罗斯福在演说中哀叹美国企业界权力的集中,或称"集体主义",呼吁通过更多联邦商业管制来重新引入"民主竞争秩序"。哈耶克当时对美国相对于英国在自由企业方面的未来道路更为乐观。

[注-原-2] 即便在1931年这一年,《麦克米伦报告》已经可以谈及"近年来本国政府观念的转变,无论哪个政党执政,政府都日益关注对人民生活的管理",并补充说"议会发现自己越来越多地从事这样的立法活动:其有意识的目标是规范社会的日常事务,如今它干预的事情在过去被认为完全不在其职权范围之内。"这番话是在1931年之前说的。后来在同一年,英国最终一头扎了进去,在1931-39年那短短而不光彩的几年里,把自己的经济体系改造得面目全非。[Hayek refers to the Committee on Finance and Industry Report, Cmd. 3897 (London: HMSO, 1931)]

[注-原-3] 关于阿克顿和托克维尔的更多内容,参见1956年美国平装版序言,注10和注22。

[注-原-4] 甚至那些已被证明可怕地应验了的、时间上离我们更近的警告,也几乎完全被遗忘了。距今不到三十年前,希莱尔·贝洛克在一本书中解释说"社会主义学说对资本主义社会的影响,是产生出一个不同于其两个孕育者的第三种东西——也就是奴役国家"。这本书对后来德国发生的事情的解释,超过了大多数事后写成的著作。[French-born British writer Hilaire Belloc (1870–1953), The Servile State (1912)]

[注-原-5] 英国政治家理查德·科布登(1804-1865)和约翰·布赖特(1811-1889),都是反谷物法同盟的杰出成员,是十九世纪英国自由贸易的坚定倡导者。苏格兰政治经济学家亚当·斯密(1723-1790)在其经典著作《国富论》中赞扬自然自由体系,抨击重商主义对贸易的限制。苏格兰哲学家和历史学家(也是亚当·斯密的密友)大卫·休谟(1711-1776)是《人性论》的作者,这是英国经验主义传统的核心著作,他还著有多卷本《英国史》。英国哲学家约翰·洛克(1632-1704),英国经验主义传统的另一位成员,在《政府论两篇》中阐述了社会契约理论。英国诗人约翰·弥尔顿(1608-1674),《失乐园》和《复乐园》的作者,也写过支持英联邦和新闻自由的小册子。

[注-原-6] 文艺复兴人文主义者和世界主义学者德西德里乌斯·伊拉斯谟(1466-1536),"鹿特丹的伊拉斯谟",是《愚人颂》的作者。法国作家米歇尔·德·蒙田(1533-1592)引入了散文作为一种文学形式。在他的散文中,他对可知之物采取怀疑态度,批评那些教条地持有观点的人。罗马政治家和文学家马库斯·图利乌斯·西塞罗(公元前106-43)以其演说技巧闻名;他反对马克·安东尼的《腓力比克》最终让他付出了生命的代价。在《编年史》和《历史》中,罗马历史学家普布利乌斯·塔西佗(约55-约120)记录了公元一世纪的罗马帝国。在雅典政治家伯里克利(公元前490-429)统治期间,雅典的建筑、雕塑和戏剧蓬勃发展。希腊历史学家修昔底德(约公元前460-约400)是《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》的作者。

[注-原-7] 哈耶克在他的文章《个人主义:真与伪》中批评了认为个人主义必然与自私自利相联系的观点。

[注-原-8] 这些发展中最具命运性的,是十五和十六世纪德国资产阶级被领土诸侯征服和部分摧毁的过程——这一过程的后果至今尚未消失。[哈耶克的读者会看到他的历史引用与第一次世界大战后的类比,当时恶性通货膨胀抹去了德国中产阶级债券持有人的储蓄,为希特勒的崛起铺平了道路。斯大林巩固权力时对富农的灭绝是另一个类比。]

[注-原-9] 奥古斯特·孔德,《实证政治体系》(1851-1854),第4卷(巴黎:实证主义书店,1912年),第368-369页。法国哲学家和社会理论家奥古斯特·孔德(1798-1857)声称知识有三个阶段——神学的、形而上学的和实证的——实证是最高的。实证知识已经在许多自然科学中获得,孔德主张应该在社会研究中引入实证主义。哈耶克在他的文章《科学的反革命》和《孔德与黑格尔》中阐述和批评了孔德的观点。

[注-原-10] 哈耶克在《经济思想的趋势》中提出了类似的论点。

[注-原-11] 作者曾试图在两组文章《唯科学主义与社会研究》和《科学的反革命》中追溯这一发展的开端,这些文章发表于《经济学》杂志1941-44年。[这些文章的修订版出现在《科学的反革命:论理性的滥用研究》中,分别在第17-182页和183-363页。]

[注-原-12] 卡尔·曼海姆,《重建时代的人与社会:现代社会结构研究》(伦敦:基根·保罗,1940年),第175-176页。[匈牙利出生的社会学家卡尔·曼海姆(1893-1947)曾在海德堡和法兰克福任教,1933年逃到伦敦经济学院。作为1933年3月根据希特勒的"公务员恢复法"被解职的第一批学者之一,他受邀作为访问教授,由贝弗里奇和他的伦敦经济学院同事设立的学术自由委员会赞助。曼海姆今天主要因他对知识社会学的贡献而被铭记。]

[注-原-13] 德国唯心主义哲学家格奥尔格·威廉·弗里德里希·黑格尔(1770-1831)阐述了描述意识演化和历史进程的辩证法,革命社会理论家卡尔·马克思(1818-1883)将其置于唯物主义框架内以预测资本主义的不可避免崩溃。在他的著作《政治经济学的国民体系》中,德国出生的政治经济学家弗里德里希·李斯特(1789-1846)主张贸易保护主义。他的许多政策建议也得到了德国历史学派经济学家的支持,其中古斯塔夫·施莫勒(1838-1917)是领袖。施莫勒与奥地利学派创始人卡尔·门格尔进行了方法论之争。资本主义发展史学家维尔纳·桑巴特(1863-1941)或许是历史学派的最后一位经济学家。哈耶克认为他从左翼社会主义转向法西斯式的反资本主义体现了一种自然趋势。

[注-原-14] 关于德国社会主义传统的更多信息,参见M. C. Howard和J. E. King,《马克思主义经济学史》,第1卷1883-1914年(普林斯顿:普林斯顿大学出版社,1989年)。哈耶克编辑《集体主义经济计划》一书的目标之一,是向他的英语读者介绍一些批评德语社会主义文献的关键文献。

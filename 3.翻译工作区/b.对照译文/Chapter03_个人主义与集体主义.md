# Individualism and Collectivism
# 个人主义与集体主义

> 摘要：为避免概念混乱先行误导，本文以更平实的路径铺垫核心问题：当人们谈论"社会主义""计划"时，往往把目标与手段混为一谈。全章将厘清个人主义（individualism）与集体主义（collectivism）的界线，区分"自发秩序"（spontaneous order）与"设计秩序"，并解释"计划"（planning）在不同语义下的歧义与后果。

**[章引言 Epigraph]**

[原文]
> The socialists believe in two things which are absolutely different and perhaps even contradictory: freedom and organization. —Élie Halévy

[译文]
> 社会主义者相信两件绝对不同、甚至可能相互矛盾的东西：自由与组织。—埃利·阿莱维

## 第一节：个人主义的真义与误解

[原文]
> Before we can progress with our main problem, an obstacle has yet to be surmounted. A confusion largely responsible for the way in which we are drifting into things which nobody wants must be cleared up. This confusion concerns nothing less than the concept of socialism itself. <!-- p1.s1 -->

[译文]
> 在我们继续讨论主要问题之前，还有一个障碍需要克服。人们对某个概念的理解存在混淆，正是这种混淆在很大程度上导致我们陷入无人期望的局面。而这个被混淆的概念，恰恰就是社会主义本身。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> It may mean, and is often used to describe, merely the ideals of social justice, greater equality, and security, which are the ultimate aims of socialism. But it means also the particular method by which most socialists hope to attain these ends and which many competent people regard as the only methods by which they can be fully and quickly attained. <!-- p1.s2 -->

[译文]
> 社会主义（socialism）可能仅仅指社会正义（social justice）、更大平等（equality）和安全（security）的理想——这些是社会主义的终极目标。但它也指大多数社会主义者希望达到这些目标的特定方法。许多有能力的人认为，这是唯一能够充分而迅速地实现这些目标的方式。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> In this sense socialism means the abolition of private enterprise, of private ownership of the means of production, and the creation of a system of "planned economy" in which the entrepreneur working for profit is replaced by a central planning body. <!-- p1.s3 -->

[译文]
> 从这个意义上讲，社会主义意味着废除私人企业、私人所有制生产资料，以及建立一个"计划经济"体系，其中以利润为动力的企业家被中央计划机构所取代。<!-- p1.s3 -->

[原文]
> There are many people who call themselves socialists, although they care only about the first, who fervently believe in those ultimate aims of socialism but neither care nor understand how they can be achieved, and who are merely certain that they must be achieved, whatever the cost. <!-- p2.s1 -->

[译文]
> 许多自称社会主义者的人只关心第一种含义。他们热烈相信社会主义的终极目标，但既不关心也不理解如何实现这些目标，只是确信无论代价如何都必须实现这些目标。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> But to nearly all those to whom socialism is not merely a hope but an object of practical politics, the characteristic methods of modern socialism are as essential as the ends themselves. <!-- p2.s2 -->

[译文]
> 但对于那些把社会主义不仅视为希望、而且视为实际政治目标的人来说，现代社会主义的特征方法与其目标本身同样重要。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> Many people, on the other hand, who value the ultimate ends of socialism no less than the socialists refuse to support socialism because of the dangers to other values they see in the methods proposed by the socialists. <!-- p2.s3 -->

[译文]
> 另一方面，许多人虽然同样重视社会主义的终极目标，但因为他们看到社会主义者提议的方法对其他价值观的危害，而拒绝支持社会主义。<!-- p2.s3 -->

[原文]
> The dispute about socialism has thus become largely a dispute about means and not about ends—although the question whether the different ends of socialism can be simultaneously achieved is also involved. <!-- p2.s4 -->

[译文]
> 因此，关于社会主义的争论在很大程度上已经成为关于"手段"而非"目标"的争论——尽管"不同目标是否能同时实现"的问题也牵连其中。<!-- p2.s4 -->

## 第二节：真假个人主义的分野

[原文]
> This would be enough to create confusion. And the confusion has been further increased by the common practice of denying that those who repudiate the means value the ends. But this is not all. The situation is still more complicated by the fact that the same means, the "economic planning" which is the prime instrument of socialist reform, can be used for many other purposes. <!-- p3.s1 -->

[译文]
> 这足以造成混淆。而且，通过否认那些反对这些手段的人也重视这些目标的做法，混淆进一步加深了。但这还不是全部。更复杂的是，同样的手段——"经济计划"（economic planning，社会主义改革的主要工具）——可以用于许多其他目的。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> We must centrally direct economic activity if we want to make the distribution of income conform to current ideas of social justice. "Planning," therefore, is wanted by all those who demand that "production for use" be substituted for production for profit. But such planning is no less indispensable if the distribution of incomes is to be regulated in a way which to us appears to be the opposite of just. <!-- p3.s2 -->

[译文]
> 如果我们想让收入分配符合当前的社会正义观念，就必须集中指导经济活动。因此，所有要求用"为使用而生产"替代"为利润而生产"的人都需要"计划"。但即使收入分配要按照我们认为不公正的方式进行调节，这样的计划同样是不可或缺的。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> Whether we should wish that more of the good things of this world should go to some racial élite, the Nordic men, or the members of a party or an aristocracy, the methods which we shall have to employ are the same as those which could insure an equalitarian distribution. <!-- p3.s3 -->

[译文]
> 无论我们希望将世界上更多的好东西分配给某个种族精英、北欧人，还是某个政党或贵族阶层的成员，我们所需采用的方法都与确保平等分配的方法完全相同。<!-- p3.s3 -->

[原文]
> It may, perhaps, seem unfair to use the term "socialism" to describe its methods rather than its aims, to use for a particular method a term which for many people stands for an ultimate ideal. It is probably preferable to describe the methods which can be used for a great variety of ends as collectivism and to regard socialism as a species of that genus. <!-- p4.s1 -->

[译文]
> 用"社会主义"这个术语来描述其方法而非其目标，可能看起来不公平，因为对许多人来说，这个术语代表一个终极理想。更好的做法可能是把能够用于各种各样目标的方法称为"集体主义"（collectivism），而把社会主义视为这个属的一个"种"。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> Yet, although to most socialists only one species of collectivism will represent true socialism, it must always be remembered that socialism is a species of collectivism and that therefore everything which is true of collectivism as such must apply also to socialism. <!-- p4.s2 -->

[译文]
> 然而，虽然对大多数社会主义者来说，只有一种集体主义才代表真正的社会主义，但必须始终记住，社会主义是集体主义的一个种，因此对集体主义本身成立的一切也必然适用于社会主义。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> Nearly all the points which are disputed between socialists and liberals concern the methods common to all forms of collectivism and not the particular ends for which socialists want to use them; and all the consequences with which we shall be concerned in this book follow from the methods of collectivism irrespective of the ends for which they are used. <!-- p4.s3 -->

[译文]
> 社会主义者与自由主义者之间争论的几乎所有要点都涉及所有形式集体主义共同的方法，而不是社会主义者想要使用这些方法的特定目标。本书所关注的所有后果都源于集体主义的方法，无论这些方法用于什么目标。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> It must also not be forgotten that socialism is not only by far the most important species of collectivism or "planning" but that it is socialism which has persuaded liberal-minded people to submit once more to that regimentation of economic life which they had overthrown because, in the words of Adam Smith, it puts governments in a position where "to support themselves they are obliged to be oppressive and tyrannical." <!-- p4.s4 -->

[译文]
> 还必须记住两点：第一，社会主义是迄今为止最重要的集体主义或"计划"形式；第二，正是社会主义说服了自由主义者重新接受对经济生活的严格管制——而这正是他们曾经推翻的制度。用亚当·斯密的话说，这种管制会把政府置于这样一种境地："为了维持自身，他们不得不采取压迫和专制的手段。"<!-- p4.s4 -->

## 第三节：集体主义的理论基础

[原文]
> The difficulties caused by the ambiguities of the common political terms are not yet over if we agree to use the term "collectivism" so as to include all types of "planned economy," whatever the end of planning. The meaning of this term becomes somewhat more definite if we make it clear that we mean that sort of planning which is necessary to realize any given distributive ideals. But, as the idea of central economic planning owes its appeal largely to this very vagueness of its meaning, it is essential that we should agree on its precise sense before we discuss its consequences. <!-- p5.s1 -->

[译文]
> 即使我们同意使用"集体主义"这个术语来包括所有类型的"计划经济"，无论计划的目标是什么，由常见政治术语的歧义造成的困难仍未解决。如果我们明确指出我们指的是实现任何既定分配理想所必需的那种计划，这个术语的含义就会变得更加明确。但由于中央经济计划的吸引力在很大程度上源于其含义的模糊性，在我们讨论其后果之前，必须就其确切含义达成一致。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> "Planning" owes its popularity largely to the fact that everybody desires, of course, that we should handle our common problems as rationally as possible and that, in so doing, we should use as much foresight as we can command. In this sense everybody who is not a complete fatalist is a planner, every political act is (or ought to be) an act of planning, and there can be differences only between good and bad, between wise and foresighted and foolish and shortsighted planning. <!-- p5.s2 -->

[译文]
> "计划"之所以受欢迎，在很大程度上是因为每个人当然都希望我们尽可能理性地处理共同问题，并尽可能地运用我们能够掌握的远见。从这个意义上讲，每个不是完全宿命论者的人都是计划者，每一项政治行为都是（或应该是）一种计划行为。在这种意义下，差异只存在于好的计划与坏的计划、明智的计划与短视的计划之间。<!-- p5.s2 -->

[原文]
> An economist, whose whole task is the study of how men actually do and how they might plan their affairs, is the last person who could object to planning in this general sense. But it is not in this sense that our enthusiasts for a planned society now employ this term, nor merely in this sense that we must plan if we want the distribution of income or wealth to conform to some particular standard. <!-- p5.s3 -->

[译文]
> 经济学家的整个任务是研究人们实际上如何以及如何可能计划他们的事务，因此他最支持这种一般意义上的计划。但我们的计划社会热情者现在使用这个术语的含义并非如此。我们想要收入或财富分配符合某个特定标准时所需的计划，也不仅仅是这种一般意义上的计划。<!-- p5.s3 -->

[原文]
> According to the modern planners, and for their purposes, it is not sufficient to design the most rational permanent framework within which the various activities would be conducted by different persons according to their individual plans. This liberal plan, according to them, is no plan—and it is, indeed, not a plan designed to satisfy particular views about who should have what. What our planners demand is a central direction of all economic activity according to a single plan, laying down how the resources of society should be "consciously directed" to serve particular ends in a definite way. <!-- p5.s4 -->

[译文]
> 根据现代计划者的观点，为了他们的目的，仅仅设计一个最理性的永久框架是不够的，在这个框架内，各种活动由不同的人根据他们的个人计划进行。根据他们的说法，这种自由主义计划根本不是计划——事实上，它不是一个旨在满足关于谁应该拥有什么的特定观点的计划。我们的计划者要求的是根据单一计划对所有经济活动进行中央指导，规定社会的资源应该如何"有意识地指导"以特定的方式服务于特定的目标。<!-- p5.s4 -->

## 第四节：自发秩序与设计秩序

[原文]
> The dispute between the modern planners and their opponents is, therefore, not a dispute on whether we ought to choose intelligently between the various possible organizations of society; it is not a dispute on whether we ought to employ foresight and systematic thinking in planning our common affairs. It is a dispute about what is the best way of so doing. The question is whether for this purpose it is better that the holder of coercive power should confine himself in general to creating conditions under which the knowledge and initiative of individuals are given the best scope so that they can plan most successfully; or whether a rational utilization of our resources requires central direction and organization of all our activities according to some consciously constructed "blueprint." <!-- p6.s1 -->

[译文]
> 因此，现代计划者与其反对者之间的争论不是关于我们是否应该在社会的各种可能组织形式之间进行理性选择，也不是关于我们是否应该在计划共同事务时运用远见和系统思维。这是关于进行这种选择的最佳方式的争论。具体问题是：是更好地让强制权力的持有者限制自己，创造条件使个人的知识和主动性得到最大发挥，从而他们能够最成功地进行计划？还是理性利用我们的资源需要根据某个有意识构建的"蓝图"对所有活动进行中央指导和组织？<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> The socialists of all parties have appropriated the term "planning" for planning of the latter type, and it is now generally accepted in this sense. But though this is meant to suggest that this is the only rational way of handling our affairs, it does not, of course, prove this. It remains the point on which the planners and the liberals disagree. <!-- p6.s2 -->

[译文]
> 各党派的社会主义者已经把"计划"这个术语据为己有，用于后一种类型的计划，现在这个术语通常在这个意义上被接受。但虽然这意味着暗示这是处理我们事务的唯一理性方式，但这当然不能证明这一点。这仍然是计划者和自由主义者不同意的要点。<!-- p6.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is important not to confuse opposition against this kind of planning with a dogmatic laissez faire attitude. The liberal argument is in favor of making the best possible use of the forces of competition as a means of coordinating human efforts, not an argument for leaving things just as they are. It is based on the conviction that, where effective competition can be created, it is a better way of guiding individual efforts than any other. <!-- p6.s3 -->

[译文]
> 重要的是不要把对这种计划的反对与教条式的自由放任态度混淆。自由主义的论证赞成尽可能好地利用竞争的力量作为协调人类努力的手段，而不是主张让事情保持原样。它基于这样的信念：在能够创造有效竞争的地方，竞争是指导个人努力的比任何其他方式都更好的方式。<!-- p6.s3 -->

[原文]
> It does not deny, but even emphasizes, that, in order that competition should work beneficially, a carefully thought-out legal framework is required and that neither the existing nor the past legal rules are free from grave defects. Nor does it deny that, where it is impossible to create the conditions necessary to make competition effective, we must resort to other methods of guiding economic activity. Economic liberalism is opposed, however, to competition's being supplanted by inferior methods of coordinating individual efforts. And it regards competition as superior not only because it is in most circumstances the most efficient method known but even more because it is the only method by which our activities can be adjusted to each other without coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority. <!-- p6.s4 -->

[译文]
> 它不仅不否认，而且强调，为了使竞争有益地发挥作用，需要一个精心设计的法律框架。现有的和过去的法律规则都存在严重缺陷。它也不否认，在不可能创造使竞争有效所必需的条件的地方，我们必须诉诸其他指导经济活动的方法。然而，经济自由主义反对竞争被其他不如竞争有效的协调方式所取代。它认为竞争优越，不仅因为在大多数情况下它是已知最有效的方法，更因为它是唯一能够使我们的活动相互调整而无需权力的强制或武断干预的方法。<!-- p6.s4 -->

[原文]
> Indeed, one of the main arguments in favor of competition is that it dispenses with the need for "conscious social control" and that it gives the individuals a chance to decide whether the prospects of a particular occupation are sufficient to compensate for the disadvantages and risks connected with it. <!-- p7.s1 -->

[译文]
> 事实上，支持竞争的主要论证之一是它消除了"有意识的社会控制"的必要性，并给了个人一个机会来决定某个特定职业的前景是否足以补偿与之相关的劣势和风险。<!-- p7.s1 -->

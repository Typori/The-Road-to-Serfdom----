# Planning and the Rule of Law
# 计划与法治

> 摘要：本章分析法治原则与计划经济的矛盾。法治要求政府行为受预先制定的通则约束，而计划经济要求政府根据当时情况做出具体的、不可预测的决定。这导致计划社会必然放弃法治，转向以\"公平\"和\"合理\"等模糊标准进行统治的专断权力。本章论证了法治的真正含义不在于所有行为都合法，而在于权力受到固定规则的限制。

## 第一节：法治的本质与计划经济的相悖

[原文]
> Nothing distinguishes more clearly conditions in a free country from those in a country under arbitrary government than the observance in the former of the great principles known as the Rule of Law. Stripped of all technicalities, this means that government in all its actions is bound by rules fixed and announced beforehand—rules which make it possible to foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercive powers in given circumstances and to plan one's individual affairs on the basis of this knowledge.

[译文]
> 没有什么比遵守被称为\"法治\"的伟大原则的情况与否更能清晰地区分自由国家和专制统治国家。法治的本质——剔除所有技术性细节——意味着政府的所有行为都受到事先固定且公开宣布的规则的约束。这些规则使人们能够在相当程度的确定性内预见政府在特定情形下将如何运用其强制权力，从而能够基于这一知识来规划个人事务。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> Though this ideal can never be perfectly achieved, since legislators as well as those to whom the administration of the law is entrusted are fallible men, the essential point, that the discretion left to the executive organs wielding coercive power should be reduced as much as possible, is clear enough. While every law restricts individual freedom to some extent by altering the means which people may use in the pursuit of their aims, under the Rule of Law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ad hoc action. Within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts.

[译文]
> 虽然这一理想永远无法完美实现——因为立法者和执法者都是会犯错的人——但其要义是明确的：掌握强制权力的行政机构所拥有的自由裁量权应该尽可能地被限制。每一部法律都会通过改变人们追求目标时可采取的手段，在某种程度上限制个人自由。但在法治之下，政府被阻止通过临时性的措施来破坏个人的努力。在已知的规则框架内，个人得以自由地追求其个人的目标和欲望，并且可以确信政府的权力不会被故意用来阻挠其努力。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> The distinction we have drawn before between the creation of a permanent framework of laws within which the productive activity is guided by individual decisions and the direction of economic activity by a central authority is thus really a particular case of the more general distinction between the Rule of Law and arbitrary government. Under the first the government confines itself to fixing rules determining the conditions under which the available resources may be used, leaving to the individuals the decision for what ends they are to be used. Under the second the government directs the use of the means of production to particular ends.

[译文]
> 我们之前所做的区分——即建立一个永久法律框架（在这一框架内生产活动由个人决定指导）与中央当局指导经济活动——实际上正是法治与专制统治之间更根本区分的一个特例。在第一种情形下，政府将自己限制在制定规则上，这些规则规定可用资源在何种条件下可被使用，而把资源被用于何种目的的决定权留给个人。在第二种情形下，政府直接指导生产手段的使用以实现特定的目标。<!-- p1.s3 -->

[原文]
> The first type of rules can be made in advance, in the shape of formal rules which do not aim at the wants and needs of particular people. They are intended to be merely instrumental in the pursuit of people's various individual ends. And they are, or ought to be, intended for such long periods that it is impossible to know whether they will assist particular people more than others. They could almost be described as a kind of instrument of production, helping people to predict the behavior of those with whom they must collaborate, rather than as efforts toward the satisfaction of particular needs.

[译文]
> 第一类规则可以提前制定，采取正式规则的形式，这些规则不针对特定人群的具体需要。它们仅仅是为了人们追求各种个人目标而服务的工具。而且它们被制定为长期有效的规则——或者说应该被这样制定——以至于无法预知这些规则是否会比其他人更多地帮助某些人。这些规则几乎可以被描述为一种\"生产工具\"，帮助人们预测必须与之合作的他人的行为，而非为满足特定需求而做出的努力。<!-- p1.s4 -->

[原文]
> Economic planning of the collectivist kind necessarily involves the very opposite of this. The planning authority cannot confine itself to providing opportunities for unknown people to make whatever use of them they like. It cannot tie itself down in advance to general and formal rules which prevent arbitrariness. It must provide for the actual needs of people as they arise and then choose deliberately between them. It must constantly decide questions which cannot be answered by formal principles only, and, in making these decisions, it must set up distinctions of merit between the needs of different people.

[译文]
> 集体主义型的经济计划必然与此截然相反。计划当局无法仅为未知的人提供机会让他们随意使用。它无法事先将自己约束于能够防止专断的通则和形式规则。它必须根据人们实际出现的具体需求来进行提供，然后在这些需求之间进行有意识的权衡。它必须不断地做出无法仅凭形式原则回答的决定，而且在做这些决定时，它必须在不同人群的需求之间建立功绩上的区分。<!-- p1.s5 -->

[原文]
> When the government has to decide how many pigs are to be raised or how many busses are to be run, which coal mines are to operate, or at what prices shoes are to be sold, these decisions cannot be deduced from formal principles or settled for long periods in advance. They depend inevitably on the circumstances of the moment, and, in making such decisions, it will always be necessary to balance one against the other the interests of various persons and groups. In the end somebody's views will have to decide whose interests are more important; and these views must become part of the law of the land, a new distinction of rank which the coercive apparatus of government imposes upon the people.

[译文]
> 当政府需要决定应该饲养多少头猪、运行多少辆公交车、哪些煤矿应该继续开采、或者鞋履应以何价出售时，这些决定既不能从形式原则推导出来，也不能很久之前就确定下来。它们必然取决于当前的具体环境。而在做出这样的决定时，将总是有必要在各类人群的利益之间加以权衡。最终某个人的观点将必须决定谁的利益更为重要；而这些观点必须成为国家法律的一部分，成为政府的强制机构强加给人民的一种新的身份等级。<!-- p1.s6 -->

## 第二节：形式法与实质法的根本对立

[原文]
> In our age, with its passion for conscious control of everything, it may appear paradoxical to claim as a virtue that under one system we shall know less about the particular effect of the measures the state takes than would be true under most other systems and that a method of social control should be deemed superior because of our ignorance of its precise results. Yet this consideration is in fact the rationale of the great liberal principle of the Rule of Law. And the apparent paradox dissolves rapidly when we follow the argument a little further.

[译文]
> 在一个热衷于对一切进行有意识控制的时代，声称在某种制度下我们对国家措施的具体效果知道得越少越好，因此某种社会控制方法应该因为我们对其确切结果的无知而被视为优越，这似乎充满了矛盾。然而这个考虑实际上正是自由主义的法治原则这一伟大理想的真实理由所在。而且当我们进一步深入论证时，这个看似的矛盾会迅速消散。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> This argument is twofold; the first is economic and can here only briefly be stated. The state should confine itself to establishing rules applying to general types of situations and should allow the individuals freedom in everything which depends on the circumstances of time and place, because only the individuals concerned in each instance can fully know these circumstances and adapt their actions to them. If the individuals are to be able to use their knowledge effectively in making plans, they must be able to predict actions of the state which may affect these plans. But if the actions of the state are to be predictable, they must be determined by rules fixed independently of the concrete circumstances which can be neither foreseen nor taken into account beforehand: and the particular effects of such actions will be unpredictable. If, on the other hand, the state were to direct the individual's actions so as to achieve particular ends, its action would have to be decided on the basis of the full circumstances of the moment and would therefore be unpredictable. Hence the familiar fact that the more the state "plans," the more difficult planning becomes for the individual.

[译文]
> 这个论证有两个方面；第一个是经济性的，这里只能简述。国家应该将自己限制在为一般类型的情形制定规则上，应该在一切取决于时间、地点等具体情况的事项上允许个人自由，因为只有在每一具体情形中的个人才能充分了解这些情况并相应调整自己的行动。若个人要能够有效地利用其知识来做计划，他们就必须能够预测可能影响这些计划的国家行动。但若国家的行动要是可预测的，它们就必须由独立于具体情况的固定规则所决定——这些情况既无法预见也无法事先考虑：而这样的行动的具体效果将是不可预测的。反之，若国家要指导个人的行动以实现特定的目标，其行动就必须基于当时的完整情况来决定，因此就将是不可预测的。由此引出了我们熟悉的事实：国家\"计划\"得越多，对个人来说计划就变得越困难。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> The second, moral or political, argument is even more directly relevant to the point under discussion. If the state is precisely to foresee the incidence of its actions, it means that it can leave those affected no choice. Wherever the state can exactly foresee the effects on particular people of alternative courses of action, it is also the state which chooses between the different ends. If we want to create new opportunities open to all, to offer chances of which people can make what use they like, the precise results cannot be foreseen. General rules, genuine laws as distinguished from specific orders, must therefore be intended to operate in circumstances which cannot be foreseen in detail, and, therefore, their effect on particular ends or particular people cannot be known beforehand. It is in this sense alone that it is at all possible for the legislator to be impartial.

[译文]
> 第二个论证——道德或政治性的——更直接地涉及讨论的问题。若国家能够精确地预见其行动的结果，这就意味着它可以对受影响的人不留选择余地。凡是国家能够精确预见其不同行动方案对特定人群的影响的地方，也就是国家在选择不同的目标。若我们要为所有人创造开放的新机遇，提供人们可以随意使用的机会，那么精确的结果就无法被预见。因此通则、真正的法律——不同于具体的命令——必须意在在无法详细预见的情况下运行，因此它对特定的目标或特定人群的影响无法事先知道。仅在这个意义上，立法者才有可能是公正的。<!-- p2.s3 -->

[原文]
> To be impartial means to have no answer to certain questions—to the kind of questions which, if we have to decide them, we decide by tossing a coin. In a world where everything was precisely foreseen, the state could hardly do anything and remain impartial.

[译文]
> 公正意味着对某些问题没有答案——对那种必须被决定时我们会通过抛硬币来决定的问题没有答案。在一个一切都能精确预见的世界中，国家几乎无法做任何事情而仍然保持公正。<!-- p2.s4 -->

[原文]
> Where the precise effects of government policy on particular people are known, where the government aims directly at such particular effects, it cannot help knowing these effects, and therefore it cannot be impartial. It must, of necessity, take sides, impose its valuations upon people and, instead of assisting them in the advancement of their own ends, choose the ends for them. As soon as the particular effects are foreseen at the time a law is made, it ceases to be a mere instrument to be used by the people and becomes instead an instrument used by the lawgiver upon the people and for his ends. The state ceases to be a piece of utilitarian machinery intended to help individuals in the fullest development of their individual personality and becomes a "moral" institution— where "moral" is not used in contrast to immoral but describes an institution which imposes on its members its views on all moral questions, whether these views be moral or highly immoral. In this sense the Nazi or any other collectivist state is "moral," while the liberal state is not.

[译文]
> 当政府政策对特定人群的精确效果是已知的，当政府直接针对这样的特定效果时，它无法不知道这些效果，因此它无法保持公正。它必然要站队，把它的价值判断强加给人民，而不是帮助他们推进自己的目标，而是为他们选择目标。一旦法律在制定时其特定的效果就能被预见，法律就不再是被人民使用的纯粹工具，而是变成了立法者用来作用于人民、为其目的而使用的工具。国家不再是一个旨在帮助个人充分发展其个性的功利性机器，而是变成了一个\"道德的\"机构——这里\"道德的\"不是与不道德相对比，而是描述一个把其对所有道德问题的观点强加给其成员的机构，无论这些观点本身是否道德或极其不道德。从这个意义上说，纳粹国家或任何其他集体主义国家都是\"道德的\"，而自由国家则不是。<!-- p2.s5 -->

## 第三节：计划的必然后果：法治的消亡

[原文]
> Perhaps it will be said that all this raises no serious problem because in the kind of questions which the economic planner would have to decide he need not and should not be guided by his individual prejudices but could rely on the general conviction of what is fair and reasonable. This contention usually receives support from those who have experience of planning in a particular industry and who find that there is no insuperable difficulty about arriving at a decision which all those immediately interested will accept as fair. The reason why this experience proves nothing is, of course, the selection of the "interests" concerned when planning is confined to a particular industry. Those most immediately interested in a particular issue are not necessarily the best judges of the interests of society as a whole.

[译文]
> 有人可能会说这不提出任何严肃的问题，因为经济计划者必须做决定的这类问题上，他不需要也不应该受个人偏见的引导，而可以依赖关于什么是公平和合理的普遍信念。这个说法通常得到有在特定产业规划经验的人的支持，他们发现要得到所有直接相关方都接受为公平的决定并无不可逾越的困难。这种经验之所以证明不了任何东西，当然是因为当规划仅限于特定产业时对\"利益\"的选择。在某一特定问题上直接相关的利益方不必然是判断整个社会利益的最佳仲裁者。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> To take only the most characteristic case: when capital and labor in an industry agree on some policy of restriction and thus exploit the consumers, there is usually no difficulty about the division of the spoils in proportion to former earnings or on some similar principle. The loss which is divided between thousands or millions is usually either simply disregarded or quite inadequately considered. If we want to test the usefulness of the principle of "fairness" in deciding the kind of issues which arise in economic planning, we must apply it to some question where the gains and the losses are seen equally clearly. In such instances it is readily recognized that no general principle such as fairness can provide an answer. When we have to choose between higher wages for nurses or doctors and more extensive services for the sick, more milk for children and better wages for agricultural workers, or between employment for the unemployed or better wages for those already employed, nothing short of a complete system of values in which every want of every person or group has a definite place is necessary to provide an answer.

[译文]
> 以最典型的例子来说：当某产业的资本和劳动力就某项限制政策达成一致，从而剥削消费者时，关于如何按照过去的收益或某些类似原则来分割所得通常没有难度。在数千或数百万人之间分散的损失通常要么完全被忽视，要么被严重不充分地考虑。若我们要检验\"公平\"原则在决定经济规划中出现的问题时的效用，我们必须把它应用到某个得失都能同样清楚地看到的问题上。在这样的情况下，很容易看出没有什么通则——比如公平——能够提供答案。当我们必须在护士或医生的更高工资与病人的更广泛的服务之间选择，在儿童的更多牛奶与农业工人的更好工资之间选择，或在给失业者提供就业与给已就业者提供更好工资之间选择时，没有比一个每个人或群体的每个需求都有明确位置的完整价值体系更少的东西是无法提供答案的。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> In fact, as planning becomes more and more extensive, it becomes regularly necessary to qualify legal provisions increasingly by reference to what is "fair" or "reasonable"; this means that it becomes necessary to leave the decision of the concrete case more and more to the discretion of the judge or authority in question. One could write a history of the decline of the Rule of Law, the disappearance of the Rechtsstaat, in terms of the progressive introduction of these vague formulas into legislation and jurisdiction, and of the increasing arbitrariness and uncertainty of, and the consequent disrespect for, the law and the judicature, which in these circumstances could not but become an instrument of policy.

[译文]
> 实际上，随着计划变得越来越广泛，越来越有必要用\"公平的\"或\"合理的\"这样的含糊标准来限定法律条款；这意味着越来越有必要把具体案件的决定留给相关法官或当局的自由裁量权。人们可以用这些含糊公式在立法和司法中的逐步引入，以及由此导致的法律和司法制度的越来越多的专断和不确定，以及对法律和司法制度由此而来的日益增长的不尊重，来写法治的衰落史、Rechtsstaat的消亡史。在这些情况下法律和司法制度不得不变成了政策的工具。<!-- p3.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is important to point out once more in this connection that this process of the decline of the Rule of Law had been going on steadily in Germany for some time before Hitler came into power and that a policy well advanced toward totalitarian planning had already done a great deal of the work which Hitler completed.

[译文]
> 重要的是要再次指出，法治衰落的这个过程在希特勒上台前的某段时间内在德国一直稳定进行，一项朝向极权计划大幅推进的政策早已完成了希特勒随后完成的许多工作。<!-- p3.s4 -->

[原文]
> There can be no doubt that planning necessarily involves deliberate discrimination between particular needs of different people, and allowing one man to do what another must be prevented from doing. It must lay down by a legal rule how well off particular people shall be and what different people are to be allowed to have and do. It means in effect a return to the rule of status, a reversal of the "movement of progressive societies" which, in the famous phrase of Sir Henry Maine, "has hitherto been a movement from status to contract."

[译文]
> 毫无疑问，计划必然涉及对不同人群的特定需求的有意识的区别对待，允许某个人做另一个人必须被阻止做的事。它必须通过法律规则规定特定的人应该多富有，不同的人应该被允许拥有和做什么。它实际上意味着回到身份等级制，是对\"进步社会的运动\"的反转——这运动正如亨利·梅因爵士的著名表述，\"迄今为止一直是从身份到契约的运动\"。<!-- p3.s5 -->

[原文]
> Indeed, the Rule of Law, more than the rule of contract, should probably be regarded as the true opposite of the rule of status. It is the Rule of Law, in the sense of the rule of formal law, the absence of legal privileges of particular people designated by authority, which safeguards that equality before the law which is the opposite of arbitrary government.

[译文]
> 实际上，与其说契约规则，不如说法治更应该被看作是身份等级制的真正的对立面。正是法治——在形式法规则的意义上，即不存在由当局指定的特定人群拥有的法律特权——维护了法律面前的平等，这正是专制统治的对立面。<!-- p3.s6 -->

[原文]
> A necessary, and only apparently paradoxical, result of this is that formal equality before the law is in conflict, and in fact incompatible, with any activity of the government deliberately aiming at material or substantive equality of different people, and that any policy aiming directly at a substantive ideal of distributive justice must lead to the destruction of the Rule of Law. To produce the same result for different people, it is necessary to treat them differently. To give different people the same objective opportunities is not to give them the same subjective chance. It cannot be denied that the Rule of Law produces economic inequality—all that can be claimed for it is that this inequality is not designed to affect particular people in a particular way. It is very significant and characteristic that socialists (and Nazis) have always protested against "merely" formal justice, that they have always objected to a law which had no views on how well off particular people ought to be, and that they have always demanded a "socialization of the law," attacked the independence of judges, and at the same time given their support to all such movements as the Freirechtsschule which undermined the Rule of Law.

[译文]
> 这的一个必然的、仅仅看似自相矛盾的结果是，形式上法律面前的平等与政府任何直接旨在实现不同人群的物质或实质平等的活动相冲突，实际上是不相容的，而且任何直接针对分配正义的实质理想的政策都必然导致法治的摧毁。为了对不同人群产生相同的结果，必须以不同的方式对待他们。给不同人群相同的客观机遇不等于给他们相同的主观机会。不能否认法治产生了经济不平等——对它所能宣称的仅仅是这种不平等不是为了以特定的方式影响特定的人。这是极其重要且具有特征的：社会主义者（和纳粹分子）总是反对\"仅仅\"形式上的正义，总是反对对特定人群应该多富有没有观点的法律，总是要求\"法律的社会化\"，攻击法官的独立性，同时又支持所有如Freirechtsschule这样的破坏法治的运动。<!-- p3.s7 -->

## 第四节：法治的困境与民主的悖论

[原文]
> It may even be said that for the Rule of Law to be effective it is more important that there should be a rule applied always without exceptions than what this rule is. Often the content of the rule is indeed of minor importance, provided the same rule is universally enforced. To revert to a former example: it does not matter whether we all drive on the left- or on the right-hand side of the road so long as we all do the same. The important thing is that the rule enables us to predict other people's behavior correctly, and this requires that it should apply to all cases—even if in a particular instance we feel it to be unjust.

[译文]
> 甚至可以说，对法治的有效性来说，存在一个规则并始终不留例外地适用它，比这个规则本身是什么更为重要。规则的内容往往确实是次要的，前提是同一规则得到普遍的执行。回到之前的例子：我们是都靠左行驶还是都靠右行驶并不重要，只要我们都一样就行。重要的是规则使我们能够准确地预测他人的行为，这要求它应该适用于所有情况——即使在某一特定情形我们觉得它是不公正的。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> The Rule of Law thus implies limits to the scope of legislation: it restricts it to the kind of general rules known as formal law and excludes legislation either directly aimed at particular people or at enabling anybody to use the coercive power of the state for the purpose of such discrimination. It means, not that everything is regulated by law, but, on the contrary, that the coercive power of the state can be used only in cases defined in advance by the law and in such a way that it can be foreseen how it will be used. A particular enactment can thus infringe the Rule of Law. Anyone ready to deny this would have to contend that whether the Rule of Law prevails today in Germany, Italy, or Russia depends on whether the dictators have obtained their absolute power by constitutional means.

[译文]
> 因此法治意味着对立法范围的限制：它把立法限制在被称为形式法的那种通则，并排除要么直接针对特定人群的立法，要么使任何人能够为了这样的区别对待而使用国家强制权力的立法。它意味着，不是一切都被法律规范，而是相反，国家的强制权力只能被用于事前由法律定义的情况中，而且用法的方式应该是可以预见的。因此某一特定的法律条款可能违反法治。谁若准备否认这一点，就必须声称法治今天在德国、意大利或俄国是否盛行取决于独裁者是否通过宪法手段获得了绝对权力。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> To say that in a planned society the Rule of Law cannot hold is, therefore, not to say that the actions of the government will not be legal or that such a society will necessarily be lawless. It means only that the use of the government's coercive powers will no longer be limited and determined by pre-established rules. The law can, and to make a central direction of economic activity possible must, legalize what to all intents and purposes remains arbitrary action. If the law says that such a board or authority may do what it pleases, anything that board or authority does is legal—but its actions are certainly not subject to the Rule of Law. By giving the government unlimited powers, the most arbitrary rule can be made legal; and in this way a democracy may set up the most complete despotism imaginable.

[译文]
> 因此说在计划社会中法治无法存在，并不是说政府的行动将不是法律意义上合法的，或这样的社会必然是无法可依的。它仅仅意味着政府强制权力的使用将不再受预先确立的规则的限制和决定。法律可以，而且为了使经济活动的中央指导成为可能必须，将本质上仍然是专断的行动合法化。若法律说某个董事会或当局可以随心所欲地行动，那么这个董事会或当局做的任何事都是合法的——但其行动肯定不受法治的约束。通过给政府无限的权力，最专断的统治可以被合法化；通过这种方式，民主可以建立起可以想象的最彻底的专制制度。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> If, however, the law is to enable authorities to direct economic life, it must give them powers to make and enforce decisions in circumstances which cannot be foreseen and on principles which cannot be stated in generic form. The consequence is that, as planning extends, the delegation of legislative powers to diverse boards and authorities becomes increasingly common. When before the last war, in a case to which the late Lord Hewart has recently drawn attention, Mr. Justice Darling said that "Parliament had enacted only last year that the Board of Agriculture in acting as they did should be no more impeachable than Parliament itself," this was still a rare thing. It has since become an almost daily occurrence. Constantly the broadest powers are conferred on new authorities which, without being bound by fixed rules, have almost unlimited discretion in regulating this or that activity of the people.

[译文]
> 然而，若法律要使当局能够指导经济生活，它就必须给予他们在无法预见的情况下做决定和在无法以通则形式陈述的原则基础上做决定的权力。结果是，随着计划的扩展，把立法权委派给各种董事会和当局变得越来越普遍。当在上次大战前，在已故的赫瓦特勋爵最近引起注意的一个案子中，达林法官说\"议会仅在去年就制定法律规定农业董事会在其行动中不应该比议会本身更容易受到质讯\"时，这仍然是罕见的。自那以后它已经变成了几乎每天的事。不断地，最广泛的权力被赋予新的当局，这些当局没有被固定规则束缚，在规范人民的这个或那个活动中拥有几乎无限的自由裁量权。<!-- p4.s4 -->

[原文]
> Whether, as in some countries, the main applications of the Rule of Law are laid down in a bill of rights or in a constitutional code, or whether the principle is merely a firmly established tradition, matters comparatively little. But it will readily be seen that, whatever form it takes, any such recognized limitations of the powers of legislation imply the recognition of the inalienable right of the individual, inviolable rights of man.

[译文]
> 无论是像某些国家那样法治的主要运用被规定在权利法案或宪法规范中，还是该原则仅仅是一个牢固确立的传统，这相对来说没有那么重要。但很容易看出，无论采取什么形式，任何这样被认可的对立法权力的限制都意味着对个人不可转让的权利、人类不可侵犯的权利的承认。<!-- p4.s5 -->

[原文]
> It is pathetic but characteristic of the muddle into which many of our intellectuals have been led by the conflicting ideals in which they believe that a leading advocate of the most comprehensive central planning like H. G. Wells should at the same time write an ardent defense of the rights of man. The individual rights which Mr. Wells hopes to preserve would inevitably obstruct the planning which he desires. To some extent he seems to realize the dilemma, and we find therefore the provisions of his proposed "Declaration of the Rights of Man" so hedged about with qualifications that they lose all significance. While, for instance, his declaration proclaims that every man "shall have the right to buy and sell without any discriminatory restrictions anything which may be lawfully bought and sold," which is admirable, he immediately proceeds to make the whole provision nugatory by adding that it applies only to buying and selling "in such quantities and with such reservations as are compatible with the common welfare."

[译文]
> 这既可怜又具有特征地表明，许多我们的知识分子已经陷入了因他们所信的相互冲突的理想而造成的混乱——像H.G.威尔斯这样最全面的中央计划的倡导者同时能够写出对人权的热烈辩护。威尔斯先生希望保护的个人权利必然会阻碍他所期望的计划。他似乎在某种程度上意识到了这个困境，因此我们发现他提议的\"人权宣言\"的条款充满了各种限制条件，以至于失去了所有的实际意义。例如，他的宣言声明每个人\"应该有权买卖任何可以合法买卖的东西而不受任何区别对待的限制\"，这无疑是值得赞叹的，但他立即通过补充该权利仅适用于\"以与共同福祉相容的数量和保留意见下\"的买卖而使整个条款变成废话。<!-- p4.s6 -->

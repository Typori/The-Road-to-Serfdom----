# Planning and Democracy
# 计划与民主

> 摘要：本章揭示计划经济与民主制度的根本矛盾。在一个需要中央计划的社会中，民主无法充分发挥作用，因为多数人可能同意需要计划，但无法就具体计划达成一致。这导致权力必然从民主议会转向专家和独裁者，最终演变为极权制度。本章论证了为何计划必然导向独裁，而非独裁必然摧毁自由。

## 第一节：集体主义的本质与计划的逻辑

[原文]
> The statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be trusted to no council and senate whatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it. —Adam Smith1

[译文]
> 任何政治家若胆敢对普通百姓指示其应当如何运用资本，不仅是给自己平添了许多不必要的烦恼，更是僭越了一种权力——这种权力不应被委任给任何议会或参议院，在那些自以为足以驾驭它的愚蠢而专制的人手中尤其危险。——亚当·斯密1

[原文]
> The common features of all collectivist systems may be described, in a phrase ever dear to socialists of all schools, as the deliberate organization of the labors of society for a definite social goal. That our present society lacks such "conscious" direction toward a single aim, that its activities are guided by the whims and fancies of irresponsible individuals, has always been one of the main complaints of its socialist critics.

[译文]
> 用社会主义各派都喜爱的一个说法来表述，所有集体主义制度的共同特征就是：有意识地将社会的劳动组织起来，为某一明确的社会目标服务。社会主义的批评者一直声称，我们当今的社会缺乏这种\"有意识\"的单一方向，其经济活动全凭不负责任的个人的好恶摆布。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> In many ways this puts the basic issue very clearly. And it directs us at once to the point where the conflict arises between individual freedom and collectivism. The various kinds of collectivism, communism, fascism, etc., differ among themselves in the nature of the goal toward which they want to direct the efforts of society.

[译文]
> 这个说法在许多方面已经将问题的实质表露无遗，直指个人自由与集体主义冲突的源头。各种集体主义制度——共产主义、法西斯主义等——在它们各自追求的社会目标上有所不同。<!-- p1.s2a -->

[原文]
> But they all differ from liberalism and individualism in wanting to organize the whole of society and all its resources for this unitary end and in refusing to recognize autonomous spheres in which the ends of the individuals are supreme. In short, they are totalitarian in the true sense of this new word which we have adopted to describe the unexpected but nevertheless inseparable manifestations of what in theory we call collectivism.

[译文]
> 但它们都有共同点：与自由主义和个人主义不同，它们都要把整个社会及其全部资源组织起来为单一目标服务，同时拒绝承认个人目标至高无上的独立领域的存在。简言之，它们都是\"极权主义\"的——这个新词的本义正是用来描述集体主义理论所不可避免产生的那些出人意料、却又紧密相连的现象。<!-- p1.s2b -->

[原文]
> The "social goal," or "common purpose," for which society is to be organized is usually vaguely described as the "common good," the "general welfare," or the "general interest." It does not need much reflection to see that these terms have no sufficiently definite meaning to determine a particular course of action.

[译文]
> 社会应为之组织的这个\"社会目标\"或\"共同目的\"，通常都被模糊地描述为\"共同善\"、\"普遍福祉\"或\"普遍利益\"。只消稍加思考就能看出，这些词汇都没有足够的明确性来指导某一特定的行动方针。<!-- p1.s3a -->

[原文]
> The welfare and the happiness of millions cannot be measured on a single scale of less and more. The welfare of a people, like the happiness of a man, depends on a great many things that can be provided in an infinite variety of combinations. It cannot be adequately expressed as a single end, but only as a hierarchy of ends, a comprehensive scale of values in which every need of every person is given its place.

[译文]
> 数百万人的福祉与幸福无法用一个统一的标度来衡量。一个民族的福祉就像个人的幸福一样，取决于众多事物的组合，而这种组合的方式可以是无穷无尽的。因此福祉无法用单一的目标来充分表达，而只能用一个目标的等级体系来表达——即一个综合的价值尺度，在其中每个人的每一项需求都有其相应的位置。<!-- p1.s3b -->

[原文]
> To direct all our activities according to a single plan presupposes that every one of our needs is given its rank in an order of values which must be complete enough to make it possible to decide among all the different courses which the planner has to choose. It presupposes, in short, the existence of a complete ethical code in which all the different human values are allotted their due place.

[译文]
> 要用单一的计划来指导我们所有的活动，就必须预设一件事：我们的每一项需求都在某个价值等级体系中被赋予了其位置，这个体系必须足够完整，足以使计划者能在各种可选方案之间做出决策。简言之，这要求存在一个完整的伦理准则，在其中所有人类的不同价值都被恰当地安置。<!-- p1.s4 -->

[原文]
> The conception of a complete ethical code is unfamiliar, and it requires some effort of imagination to see what it involves. We are not in the habit of thinking of moral codes as more or less complete. The fact that we are constantly choosing between different values without a social code prescribing how we ought to choose does not surprise us and does not suggest to us that our moral code is incomplete.

[译文]
> \"完整伦理准则\"这个观念对我们来说很陌生，需要费力去想象它究竟涉及什么。我们通常不习惯把道德准则看作完整或不完整。我们不断地在没有社会准则指导的情况下在不同价值观间进行选择，对此我们既不感到意外，也不会因此觉得我们的道德准则有所缺陷。<!-- p1.s5a -->

[原文]
> In our society there is neither occasion nor reason why people should develop common views about what should be done in such situations. But where all the means to be used are the property of society and are to be used in the name of society according to a unitary plan, a "social" view about what ought to be done must guide all decisions. In such a world we should soon find that our moral code is full of gaps.

[译文]
> 这是因为在我们的社会中，人们既无机会也无理由就这类情况的处理达成共识。然而，一旦所有的经济手段都成为社会的财产，并根据统一的计划以社会的名义来使用，一种\"社会\"的观点就必须指导所有的决策。在这样一个世界中，我们很快就会发现我们的道德准则充满了无法弥补的漏洞。<!-- p1.s5b -->

[原文]
> We are not concerned here with the question whether it would be desirable to have such a complete ethical code. It may merely be pointed out that up to the present the growth of civilization has been accompanied by a steady diminution of the sphere in which individual actions are bound by fixed rules. The rules of which our common moral code consists have progressively become fewer and more general in character. From the primitive man, who was bound by an elaborate ritual in almost every one of his daily activities, who was limited by innumerable taboos, and who could scarcely conceive of doing things in a way different from his fellows, morals have more and more tended to become merely limits circumscribing the sphere within which the individual could behave as he liked.

[译文]
> 我们这里无需讨论是否值得拥有这样一个完整的伦理准则。只需指出：迄今为止，文明的进步一直伴随着由固定规则约束个人行为的领域在持续缩小。我们共同道德准则所包含的规则已经变得越来越少，且越来越具有通则性。从原始人开始——那时他的日常活动几乎事事都被复杂的仪式所束缚，受到无数禁忌的限制，几乎无法想象与同伴不同的行动方式——道德已经逐渐演变为仅仅是界定个人可以自由行动的范围的边界。<!-- p1.s6 -->

[原文]
> The adoption of a common ethical code comprehensive enough to determine a unitary economic plan would mean a complete reversal of this tendency.

[译文]
> 采纳一个足以确定单一经济计划的、全面的共同伦理准则，就意味着对这一历史趋势的彻底逆转。<!-- p1.s7 -->

[原文]
> The essential point for us is that no such complete ethical code exists. The attempt to direct all economic activity according to a single plan would raise innumerable questions to which the answer could be provided only by a moral rule, but to which existing morals have no answer and where there exists no agreed view on what ought to be done. People will have either no definite views or conflicting views on such questions, because in the free society in which we have lived there has been no occasion to think about them and still less to form common opinions about them.

[译文]
> 对我们至关重要的是，这样的完整伦理准则根本不存在。试图用单一计划来指导所有的经济活动，会导致无数问题的出现——这些问题只有通过道德规则才能回答，但现有的道德对此一无所知，也不存在关于应当如何处理的共同看法。对这类问题，人们要么没有明确的观点，要么持相互矛盾的观点，因为在我们一直生活的自由社会中，没有必要思考这些问题，更不用说形成关于它们的共同意见了。<!-- p1.s8 -->

## 第二节：个人主义基础与社会行动的限制

[原文]
> Not only do we not possess such an all-inclusive scale of values: it would be impossible for any mind to comprehend the infinite variety of different needs of different people which compete for the available resources and to attach a definite weight to each. For our problem it is of minor importance whether the ends for which any person cares comprehend only his own individual needs, or whether they include the needs of his closer or even those of his more distant fellows—that is, whether he is egoistic or altruistic in the ordinary senses of these words.

[译文]
> 不仅我们没有这样一个包罗万象的价值尺度，任何人的头脑都不可能理解无穷多样的不同人群需求之间的差异——这些需求相互竞争来争夺有限的资源——也不可能给每一项需求赋予确定的权重。对于我们的问题来说，某个人关心的目标是仅限于他个人的需求，还是也包括他亲近之人甚至更远的人的需求——即他在通常意义上是自私的还是利他的——这点并非最重要。<!-- p2.s1a -->

[原文]
> The point which is so important is the basic fact that it is impossible for any man to survey more than a limited field, to be aware of the urgency of more than a limited number of needs. Whether his interests center round his own physical needs, or whether he takes a warm interest in the welfare of every human being he knows, the ends about which he can be concerned will always be only an infinitesimal fraction of the needs of all men.

[译文]
> 最为重要的事实是：任何人都不可能了解超出一定范围的领域，也不可能意识到超出一定数量的需求的紧迫性。无论他的关切是围绕自身的物质需求，还是真诚关心他认识的每个人的福祉，他所能够关心的目标终将只是全人类需求中微乎其微的一部分。<!-- p2.s1b -->

[原文]
> This is the fundamental fact on which the whole philosophy of individualism is based. It does not assume, as is often asserted, that man is egoistic or selfish or ought to be. It merely starts from the indisputable fact that the limits of our powers of imagination make it impossible to include in our scale of values more than a sector of the needs of the whole society, and that, since, strictly speaking, scales of value can exist only in individual minds, nothing but partial scales of values exist—scales which are inevitably different and often inconsistent with each other.

[译文]
> 这正是整个个人主义哲学所基于的基本事实。它并不是如人们常说的那样，假设人本性自私或应该自私。它仅仅起始于一个不可否认的事实：我们想象力的局限使得我们不可能在价值尺度中包含超出整个社会需求的某一部分，而且由于严格来讲价值尺度只能存在于个别的心灵中，因此只有部分的价值尺度存在——这些尺度必然相互不同，而且往往彼此矛盾。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> From this the individualist concludes that the individuals should be allowed, within defined limits, to follow their own values and preferences rather than somebody else's; that within these spheres the individual's system of ends should be supreme and not subject to any dictation by others. It is this recognition of the individual as the ultimate judge of his ends, the belief that as far as possible his own views ought to govern his actions, that forms the essence of the individualist position.

[译文]
> 因此个人主义者得出结论：在一定的界限内，应当允许个人追随自己的价值观和偏好，而非他人的；在这些范围内，个人的目标体系应该是至高无上的，不受他人的任何指令。正是这种对个人作为其目的的最终仲裁者的认可，这种相信个人的看法应该尽可能地支配他的行为的信念，构成了个人主义立场的精髓。<!-- p2.s3 -->

[原文]
> This view does not, of course, exclude the recognition of social ends, or rather of a coincidence of individual ends which makes it advisable for men to combine for their pursuit. But it limits such common action to the instances where individual views coincide; what are called "social ends" are for it merely identical ends of many individuals—or ends to the achievement of which individuals are willing to contribute in return for the assistance they receive in the satisfaction of their own desires. Common action is thus limited to the fields where people agree on common ends. Very frequently these common ends will not be ultimate ends to the individuals but means which different persons can use for different purposes. In fact, people are most likely to agree on common action where the common end is not an ultimate end to them but a means capable of serving a great variety of purposes.

[译文]
> 当然，这种观点并不排除对社会目标的认可，或者说对个人目标相重合这一状况的认可——正是这种重合使得人们有理由为了追求共同目标而联合在一起。但它把这样的共同行动限制在个人观点相重合的情况下；它所称的\"社会目标\"仅仅是众多个人相同的目标——或者说是个人愿意做出贡献以换取在满足自身欲望中获得帮助而共同追求的目标。因此共同行动限于人们对共同目标有共识的领域。通常这些共同目标对个人来说不是最终目标，而是可被不同个人用于不同目的的手段。事实上，人们最可能同意共同行动的情况，正是当共同目标对他们而言不是最终目标，而是可以用于多种不同目的的手段时。<!-- p2.s4 -->

[原文]
> When individuals combine in a joint effort to realize ends they have in common, the organizations, like the state, that they form for this purpose are given their own system of ends and their own means. But any organization thus formed remains one "person" among others, in the case of the state much more powerful than any of the others, it is true, yet still with its separate and limited sphere in which alone its ends are supreme. The limits of this sphere are determined by the extent to which the individuals agree on particular ends; and the probability that they will agree on a particular course of action necessarily decreases as the scope of such action extends. There are certain functions of the state on the exercise of which there will be practical unanimity among its citizens; there will be others on which there will be agreement of a substantial majority; and so on, until we come to fields where, although each individual might wish the state to act in some way, there will be almost as many views about what the government should do as there are different people.

[译文]
> 当个人为了实现共同的目标而联合行动时，他们所创立的组织——如国家——被赋予了各自的目的体系和手段。但任何这样形成的组织都只是众多\"个人\"中的一个，虽然在国家的情况下它比任何其他个人都更加强大，但它仍然只有一个独立的、有限的领域，在这个领域内它的目的才是至高无上的。这个领域的界限由个人在特定目标上达成一致的程度所决定；而当这种行动的范围扩大时，人们达成一致的可能性必然下降。国家的某些职能存在广泛的一致意见；其他职能则有绝大多数的同意；如此下去，直到我们进入这样的领域——虽然每个个人都可能希望国家在某个方面有所作为，但对政府应该做什么几乎每个人都有不同的意见。<!-- p2.s5 -->

[原文]
> We can rely on voluntary agreement to guide the action of the state only so long as it is confined to spheres where agreement exists. But not only when the state undertakes direct control in fields where there is no such agreement is it bound to suppress individual freedom. We can unfortunately not indefinitely extend the sphere of common action and still leave the individual free in his own sphere. Once the communal sector, in which the state controls all the means, exceeds a certain proportion of the whole, the effects of its actions dominate the whole system. Although the state controls directly the use of only a large part of the available resources, the effects of its decisions on the remaining part of the economic system become so great that indirectly it controls almost everything. Where, as was, for example, true in Germany as early as 1928, the central and local authorities directly control the use of more than half the national income (according to an official German estimate then, 53 per cent),2 they control indirectly almost the whole economic life of the nation. There is, then, scarcely an individual end which is not dependent for its achievement on the action of the state, and the "social scale of values" which guides the state's action must embrace practically all individual ends.

[译文]
> 我们只能在国家行动限于存在共识的领域时，才能依靠自愿一致来引导国家的行动。但问题不仅在于国家在没有共识的领域进行直接控制时必然会压制个人自由。不幸的是，我们无法无限地扩展共同行动的范围，同时仍然让个人在自己的领域内保持自由。一旦公共部门——国家在其中控制所有经济手段——超过整体经济的某个比例，其行动的影响就会主导整个经济体系。虽然国家仅直接控制了一大部分可用资源的使用权，但其决策对经济体系其余部分的影响会变得如此巨大，以至于它实际上间接地控制了几乎一切。以德国在1928年的情况为例，中央和地方当局直接控制了超过国民收入的一半（根据当时的官方德国估计，占53%）2，他们实际上间接地控制了这个国家经济生活的几乎全部。到那时，几乎没有任何个人目标的实现不依赖于国家的行动，而指导国家行动的\"社会价值尺度\"必然需要包含实际上所有的个人目标。<!-- p2.s6 -->

## 第三节：计划与民主的致命冲突

[原文]
> It is not difficult to see what must be the consequences when democracy embarks upon a course of planning which in its execution requires more agreement than in fact exists. The people may have agreed on adopting a system of directed economy because they have been convinced that it will produce great prosperity. In the discussions leading to the decision, the goal of planning will have been described by some such term as "common welfare," which only conceals the absence of real agreement on the ends of planning. Agreement will in fact exist only on the mechanism to be used. But it is a mechanism which can be used only for a common end; and the question of the precise goal toward which all activity is to be directed will arise as soon as the executive power has to translate the demand for a single plan into a particular plan. Then it will appear that the agreement on the desirability of planning is not supported by agreement on the ends the plan is to serve.

[译文]
> 不难看出，当民主制度踏上计划之路、而计划的执行又需要比现实中存在的共识远为广泛的一致意见时，必然会产生什么样的后果。人民可能同意采取有向经济体制，是因为他们相信这会带来巨大的繁荣。在通往这一决定的讨论中，计划的目标会被描述为\"共同福祉\"之类的用语，这只不过掩盖了人们在计划目标上缺乏真正共识这一事实。实际上人们只在所采用的机制上达成了一致。但这种机制只能被用于某个共同的目标；而一旦行政权力需要把对单一计划的要求转化为具体计划，关于所有活动应该指向的具体目标的问题就会浮现。届时，人们会发现对计划的必要性的同意并未建立在对计划应该服务的目标的同意基础上。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> The effect of the people's agreeing that there must be central planning, without agreeing on the ends, will be rather as if a group of people were to commit themselves to take a journey together without agreeing where they want to go: with the result that they may all have to make a journey which most of them do not want at all. That planning creates a situation in which it is necessary for us to agree on a much larger number of topics than we have been used to, and that in a planned system we cannot confine collective action to the tasks on which we can agree but are forced to produce agreement on everything in order that any action can be taken at all, is one of the features which contributes more than most to determining the character of a planned system.

[译文]
> 人民在不同意目标的情况下同意进行中央计划，其效果就像一群人承诺一起去旅行，却没有商量清楚目的地：结果就是他们可能都被迫去做一次大多数人根本不想做的旅行。计划制度造就了这样一种局面：我们必须在远比过去习惯的更多的议题上达成共识，而且在计划制度下我们无法把共同行动限制在我们能达成一致的任务上，反而被迫对所有事情都达成同意才能进行任何行动。这一点是决定计划制度性质的众多因素中贡献最大的一个。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> It may be the unanimously expressed will of the people that its parliament should prepare a comprehensive economic plan, yet neither the people nor its representatives need therefore be able to agree on any particular plan. The inability of democratic assemblies to carry out what seems to be a clear mandate of the people will inevitably cause dissatisfaction with democratic institutions. Parliaments come to be regarded as ineffective "talking shops," unable or incompetent to carry out the tasks for which they have been chosen. The conviction grows that if efficient planning is to be done, the direction must be "taken out of politics" and placed in the hands of experts—permanent officials or independent autonomous bodies.

[译文]
> 人民可能一致表示议会应该制定全面的经济计划，然而人民及其代表却不必因此能够对任何具体计划达成一致。民主议会无法执行看似是人民明确授权的任务，这将不可避免地引起对民主制度的失望。议会开始被视为无效的\"清谈馆\"，无能力或不胜任完成其被选中执行的任务。人们日益相信，若要进行有效的计划，其方向必须\"从政治中摘出\"，交由专家——常设官员或独立自治机构——手中。<!-- p3.s3 -->

[原文]
> The difficulty is well known to socialists. It will soon be half a century since the Webbs began to complain of "the increased incapacity of the House of Commons to cope with its work."3 More recently, Professor Laski has elaborated the argument: [...]

[译文]
> 这个难题为社会主义者所熟知。韦伯夫妇开始抱怨\"下院应对其工作的能力不断增强\"[注-译-1]已近半个世纪。3 近年来，拉斯基教授对这个论证进行了详细阐述：[...]<!-- p3.s4 -->

[原文]
> It is important clearly to see the causes of this admitted ineffectiveness of parliaments when it comes to a detailed administration of the economic affairs of a nation. The fault is neither with the individual representatives nor with parliamentary institutions as such but with the contradictions inherent in the task with which they are charged. They are not asked to act where they can agree, but to produce agreement on everything—the whole direction of the resources of the nation. For such a task the system of majority decision is, however, not suited. Majorities will be found where it is a choice between limited alternatives; but it is a superstition to believe that there must be a majority view on everything. There is no reason why there should be a majority in favor of any one of the different possible courses of positive action if their number is legion. Every member of the legislative assembly might prefer some particular plan for the direction of economic activity to no plan, yet no one plan may appear preferable to a majority to no plan at all.

[译文]
> 重要的是清楚地看到议会在详细管理一个国家经济事务时为何无效。过错既不在于各个代表，也不在于议会制度本身，而在于它所被赋予的任务中固有的矛盾。议会被要求的不是在有共识的地方采取行动，而是对一切事情——整个国家资源的分配方向——都产生共识。然而，多数决原则对这样的任务并不适用。只有在选择有限的备选方案时才能找到多数意见；但相信所有事情上都必然存在多数意见是一种迷信。若不同的可能行动方案多如牛毛，就没有理由认定会有多数人赞成其中任何一个方案。立法议会的每个成员都可能倾向于某个特定的经济活动计划而不是无计划，然而没有某个计划对多数人来说会比无计划更可取。<!-- p3.s5 -->

[原文]
> Nor can a coherent plan be achieved by breaking it up into parts and voting on particular issues. A democratic assembly voting and amending a comprehensive economic plan clause by clause, as it deliberates on an ordinary bill, makes nonsense. An economic plan, to deserve the name, must have a unitary conception. Even if a parliament could, proceeding step by step, agree on some scheme, it would certainly in the end satisfy nobody. A complex whole in which all the parts must be most carefully adjusted to each other cannot be achieved through a compromise between conflicting views. To draw up an economic plan in this fashion is even less possible than, for example, successfully to plan a military campaign by democratic procedure. As in strategy it would become inevitable to delegate the task to the experts.

[译文]
> 而且连贯的计划也无法通过将其分解为各个部分然后对具体问题进行投票来实现。民主议会如同审议普通法案一样，一条条地投票修改全面经济计划，这简直是荒唐。经济计划若要名副其实，必须具有统一的理念。即便议会可能通过逐步推进最终同意某个方案，那个方案最后也肯定无法让任何人满意。一个复杂的整体，其所有部分都必须相互紧密协调，无法通过相互冲突的观点间的折中来实现。用这种方式制定经济计划的可能性，甚至比用民主程序成功规划一场军事战役的可能性还要小。就像在战略中一样，把任务委派给专家将变得不可避免。<!-- p3.s6 -->

[原文]
> Yet the difference is that, while the general who is put in charge of a campaign is given a single end to which, for the duration of the campaign, all the means under his control have to be exclusively devoted, there can be no such single goal given to the economic planner, and no similar limitation of the means imposed upon him. The general has not got to balance different independent aims against each other; there is for him only one supreme goal. But the ends of an economic plan, or of any part of it, cannot be defined apart from the particular plan. It is the essence of the economic problem that the making of an economic plan involves the choice between conflicting or competing ends—different needs of different people. But which ends do so conflict, which will have to be sacrificed if we want to achieve certain others, in short, which are the alternatives between which we must choose, can only be known to those who know all the facts; and only they, the experts, are in a position to decide which of the different ends are to be given preference. It is inevitable that they should impose their scale of preferences on the community for which they plan.

[译文]
> 但有一个关键的区别：军事将领虽然被赋予一个单一的目标——在作战期间必须专一地利用其掌控的所有手段去实现这个目标——但经济计划者却无法被赋予这样的单一目标，也无法对其掌控的手段施加类似的限制。将领不需要在互不相关的多个目标之间权衡；对他来说只有一个至高无上的目标。但经济计划的目标——或其任何部分的目标——无法独立于具体的计划来定义。经济问题的本质正在于，制定经济计划必然涉及在相互冲突或竞争的目标之间做出选择——即不同人群的不同需求。但哪些目标会相互冲突，若要实现某些目标就必须牺牲哪些目标，简言之哪些才是我们必须在其间选择的备选方案，这些问题只有掌握所有事实的人才能知道；也只有这些专家才有能力决定不同目标中哪些应该得到优先权。因此他们必然会把自己的偏好尺度强加给他们所规划的社区。<!-- p3.s7 -->

[原文]
> This is not always clearly recognized, and delegation is usually justified by the technical character of the task. But this does not mean that only the technical detail is delegated, or even that the inability of parliaments to understand the technical detail is the root of the difficulty.5 Alterations in the structure of civil law are no less technical and no more difficult to appreciate in all their implications; yet nobody has yet seriously suggested that legislation there should be delegated to a body of experts. The fact is that in these fields legislation does not go beyond general rules on which true majority agreement can be achieved, while in the direction of economic activity the interests to be reconciled are so divergent that no true agreement is likely to be reached in a democratic assembly.

[译文]
> 这一点并非总是被清晰地认识到，而且委派权力通常以任务的技术性特征为由来辩护。但这并不意味着只有技术细节被委派了，甚至也不意味着议会无法理解技术细节是根本难题所在。5 民法结构的改变同样具有技术性，理解其所有含义也同样困难；然而没有人曾认真建议在那个领域把立法权委派给专家团体。事实是，在那些领域，立法只涉及能获得真正多数共识的通则，而在经济活动方向上，需要协调的利益差异是如此之大，以至于民主议会不太可能达成真正的共识。<!-- p3.s8 -->

[原文]
> It should be recognized, however, that it is not the delegation of law-making power as such which is so objectionable. To oppose delegation as such is to oppose a symptom instead of the cause and, as it may be a necessary result of other causes, to weaken the case. So long as the power that is delegated is merely the power to make general rules, there may be very good reasons why such rules should be laid down by local rather than by the central authority. The objectionable feature is that delegation is so often resorted to because the matter in hand cannot be regulated by general rules but only by the exercise of discretion in the decision of particular cases. In these instances delegation means that some authority is given power to make with the force of law what to all intents and purposes are arbitrary decisions (usually described as "judging the case on its merits").

[译文]
> 然而应该认识到，权力委派本身并非最令人反感的东西。反对权力委派本身是在反对症状而非根本原因，而且既然这可能是其他原因的必然结果，反对会削弱我们的立场。只要委派的权力仅仅是制定通则的权力，就很可能有充分的理由说明这样的规则应该由地方当局而非中央当局来制定。最令人反感的特征在于，权力委派往往被诉诸，是因为面对的事项无法通过通则来规范，而只能通过在具体案例决策中行使自由裁量权来处理。在这种情况下，委派权力意味着某个当局被赋予了以法律形式做出实质上是专断决定的权力（通常被描述为\"根据案情具体判断\"）。<!-- p3.s9 -->

[原文]
> The delegation of particular technical tasks to separate bodies, while a regular feature, is yet only the first step in the process whereby a democracy which embarks on planning progressively relinquishes its powers. The expedient of delegation cannot really remove the causes which make all the advocates of comprehensive planning so impatient with the impotence of democracy. The delegation of particular powers to separate agencies creates a new obstacle to the achievement of a single coordinated plan. Even if, by this expedient, a democracy should succeed in planning every sector of economic activity, it would still have to face the problem of integrating these separate plans into a unitary whole. Many separate plans do not make a planned whole—in fact, as the planners ought to be the first to admit, they may be worse than no plan. But the democratic legislature will long hesitate to relinquish the decisions on really vital issues, and so long as it does so it makes it impossible for anyone else to provide the comprehensive plan. Yet agreement that planning is necessary, together with the inability of democratic assemblies to produce a plan, will evoke stronger and stronger demands that the government or some single individual should be given powers to act on their own responsibility. The belief is becoming more and more widespread that, if things are to get done, the responsible authorities must be freed from the fetters of democratic procedure.

[译文]
> 把具体技术任务委派给独立机构虽然是常见做法，但这仅仅是民主制度在踏上计划之路后逐步放弃权力的第一步。权力委派这一权宜之计实际上无法消除促使所有全面计划倡导者对民主无能感到不耐烦的根本原因。把具体权力委派给不同机构反而为实现单一协调计划制造了新的障碍。即便通过这一权宜之计，民主制能够成功地规划经济活动的每一个部门，它仍然面临着如何把这些分散的计划整合成一个统一整体的问题。许多分散的计划无法构成一个真正的计划整体——实际上，计划者本身首先应该承认，这样的结果可能比根本没有计划还要糟糕。然而民主的立法机构将长期犹豫是否应该放弃对真正关键问题的决定权，只要它仍在犹豫，就使得他人不可能提供一个全面的计划。因此，一旦社会同意计划的必要性，同时又发现民主议会无法制定计划，就会产生越来越强烈的要求，呼吁政府或某个人被赋予按其自身责任行动的权力。日益广泛的信念认为，若要事情有所进展，负责的当局必须摆脱民主程序的桎梏。<!-- p3.s10 -->

> The cry for an economic dictator is a characteristic stage in the movement toward planning. It is now several years since one of the most acute of foreign students of England, the late Élie Halévy, suggested that, "if you take a composite photograph of Lord Eustace Percy, Sir Oswald Mosley, and Sir Stafford Cripps, I think you would find this common feature—you would find them all agreeing to say: 'We are living in economic chaos and we cannot get out of it except under some kind of dictatorial leadership.'"6 The number of influential public men whose inclusion would not materially alter the features of the "composite photograph" has since grown considerably.

[译文]
> 对经济独裁者的呼声是朝计划运动发展的一个典型阶段。已有数年，一位最敏锐的英国外国观察者、已故的埃利·哈勒维提出过这样的看法：\"如果你拍一张由尤斯特斯·珀西勋爵、奥斯瓦尔德·莫斯利爵士和斯塔福德·克里普斯爵士组成的合成照片，我认为你会发现一个共同特征——你会发现他们都同意说：'我们生活在经济混乱中，除了某种专制领导，我们无法摆脱它。'\"6 从那以后，那些属于会改变\"合成照片\"特征的有影响力的公众人物的数量已大幅增长。<!-- p3.s11 -->

[原文]
> In Germany, even before Hitler came into power, the movement had already progressed much further. It is important to remember that, for some time before 1933, Germany had reached a stage in which it had, in effect, had to be governed dictatorially. Nobody could then doubt that for the time being democracy had broken down and that sincere democrats like Brüning were no more able to govern democratically than Schleicher or von Papen.7 Hitler did not have to destroy democracy; he merely took advantage of the decay of democracy and at the critical moment obtained the support of many to whom, though they detested Hitler, he yet seemed the only man strong enough to get things done.

[译文]
> 在德国，甚至在希特勒上台之前，这一运动已经进展得远为深入。重要的是要记住，在1933年前的某段时期，德国已经进入了一个必须以专制方式进行统治的阶段。那时没有人怀疑民主已经暂时崩溃，而布吕宁这样真诚的民主人士已经无法如施莱歇尔或冯·巴本那样民主地进行统治。7 希特勒不必摧毁民主；他仅仅是利用了民主的衰落，在关键时刻获得了许多人的支持。这些人虽然厌恶希特勒，但仍然认为他是唯一足够强大、能够把事情做成的人。<!-- p3.s12 -->

## 第四节：民主的幻想与计划的必然逻辑

[原文]
> The argument by which the planners usually try to reconcile us with this development is that, so long as democracy retains ultimate control, the essentials of democracy are not affected. Thus Karl Mannheim writes: "The only [sic] way in which a planned society differs from that of the nineteenth century is that more and more spheres of social life, and ultimately each and all of them, are subjected to state control. But if a few controls can be held in check by parliamentary sovereignty, so can many. . . . In a democratic state sovereignty can be boundlessly strengthened by plenary powers without renouncing democratic control."8

[译文]
> 计划者通常试图用这样的论证来让我们接受这种发展：只要民主保有最终的控制权，民主的根本要素就不会受到影响。因此卡尔·曼海姆写道：\"一个计划社会与十九世纪社会不同的唯一方式是越来越多的社会生活领域，最终是所有领域，都受到国家的控制。但如果议会主权能制约几项控制，它也能制约许多控制。...在民主国家中，主权可以通过充分权力无限加强，而不放弃民主控制。\"8<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> This belief overlooks a vital distinction. Parliament can, of course, control the execution of tasks where it can give definite directions, where it has first agreed on the aim and merely delegates the working-out of the detail. The situation is entirely different when the reason for the delegation is that there is no real agreement on the ends, when the body charged with the planning has to choose between ends of whose conflict parliament is not even aware, and when the most that can be done is to present to it a plan which has to be accepted or rejected as a whole.

[译文]
> 这种信念忽视了一个至关重要的区别。议会当然可以控制这样的任务的执行：在这种情况下，它能够给出明确的指示，它已经事先同意了目标，仅仅委派了细节的制定。然而当委派的原因在于对目标缺乏真正的共识时，情况完全不同；此时负责计划的机构必须在议会甚至没有意识到其冲突的各种目标之间进行选择，而它最多只能把一个必须被整体接受或拒绝的计划呈给议会。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> There may and probably will be criticism; but as no majority can agree on an alternative plan, and the parts objected to can almost always be represented as essential parts of the whole, it will remain quite ineffective. Parliamentary discussion may be retained as a useful safety valve and even more as a convenient medium through which the official answers to complaints are disseminated. It may even prevent some flagrant abuses and successfully insist on particular shortcomings being remedied. But it cannot direct. It will at best be reduced to choosing the persons who are to have practically absolute power. The whole system will tend toward that plebiscitarian dictatorship in which the head of the government is from time to time confirmed in his position by popular vote, but where he has all the powers at his command to make certain that the vote will go in the direction he desires.

[译文]
> 可能会有批评，而且很可能确实会有批评；但由于没有多数能同意一个替代方案，被反对的部分几乎总能被描绘成整体的必要部分，因此批评将保持完全无效。议会讨论可能被保留下来作为一个有用的安全阀，更多地作为传播官方对投诉的回复的便利渠道。它甚至可能阻止某些明显的滥用，并成功地坚持纠正特定的缺陷。但它无法进行真正的指导。它最多会沦为选择那些拥有几乎绝对权力的人。整个系统将趋向于那种全民投票式的独裁，在其中政府首脑不时地通过民众投票来确认其地位，但他掌握了所有的权力来确保投票朝他希望的方向进行。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is the price of democracy that the possibilities of conscious control are restricted to the fields where true agreement exists and that in some fields things must be left to chance. But in a society which for its functioning depends on central planning this control cannot be made dependent on a majority's being able to agree; it will often be necessary that the will of a small minority be imposed upon the people, because this minority will be the largest group able to agree among themselves on the question at issue. Democratic government has worked successfully where, and so long as, the functions of government were, by a widely accepted creed, restricted to fields where agreement among a majority could be achieved by free discussion; and it is the great merit of the liberal creed that it reduced the range of subjects on which agreement was necessary to one on which it was likely to exist in a society of free men. It is now often said that democracy will not tolerate "capitalism." If "capitalism" means here a competitive system based on free disposal over private property, it is far more important to realize that only within this system is democracy possible. When it becomes dominated by a collectivist creed, democracy will inevitably destroy itself.

[译文]
> 民主的代价在于，有意识控制的可能性被限制在真正存在共识的领域，而在某些领域事情必须听凭机遇。但在一个为了正常运作而依赖中央计划的社会中，这种控制无法建立在多数能够达成共识的基础上；往往必要的是把小数派的意愿强加给人民，因为这个少数派将是唯一在当前问题上能够彼此达成共识的最大群体。民主政府曾成功地发挥作用的地方和时代，是在那些被广泛接受的信念限制了政府职能、只涉及通过自由讨论能获得多数同意的领域的地方和时代。自由主义信念的伟大功绩在于，它把需要达成共识的主题范围限制在了在一个自由人的社会中可能存在共识的那些主题上。现在人们常说民主将不会容忍\"资本主义\"。若\"资本主义\"在这里指的是一个基于对私人财产自由处置的竞争制度，那么更为重要的是意识到，只有在这样的制度内民主才有可能。当它被集体主义信条所主导时，民主将不可避免地自我毁灭。<!-- p4.s4 -->

[原文]
> We have no intention, however, of making a fetish of democracy. It may well be true that our generation talks and thinks too much of democracy and too little of the values which it serves. It cannot be said of democracy, as Lord Acton truly said of liberty, that it "is not a means to a higher political end. It is itself the highest political end. It is not for the sake of a good public administration that it is required, but for the security in the pursuit of the highest objects of civil society, and of private life."9 Democracy is essentially a means, a utilitarian device for safeguarding internal peace and individual freedom. As such it is by no means infallible or certain. Nor must we forget that there has often been much more cultural and spiritual freedom under an autocratic rule than under some democracies—and it is at least conceivable that under the government of a very homogeneous and doctrinaire majority democratic government might be as oppressive as the worst dictatorship.

[译文]
> 然而我们无意把民主本身当作某种宗教的对象来顶礼膜拜。我们这一代人确实对民主谈论和思考太多，而对它所服务的那些价值谈论和思考太少。对民主来说，无法像阿克顿勋爵对自由所说的那样说：\"自由不是为了某个更高的政治目标的手段。它本身就是最高的政治目标。不是为了良好的公共管理才需要自由，而是为了在追求民间社会和私人生活的最高目标时获得安全。\"9 民主本质上只是一种手段——一种为了维护国内和平与个人自由的功利性装置。因此它绝非万无一失或完全可靠。我们也不应忘记，在许多专制统治下往往存在比某些民主制下更多的文化与精神自由——而且至少可以想象，在一个高度同质化且教条专制的多数派政府下，民主政府可能与最坏的独裁一样具有压迫性。<!-- p4.s5 -->

[原文]
> Our point, however, is not that dictatorship must inevitably extirpate freedom but rather that planning leads to dictatorship because dictatorship is the most effective instrument of coercion and the enforcement of ideals and, as such, essential if central planning on a large scale is to be possible. The clash between planning and democracy arises simply from the fact that the latter is an obstacle to the suppression of freedom which the direction of economic activity requires. But in so far as democracy ceases to be a guaranty of individual freedom, it may well persist in some form under a totalitarian regime. A true "dictatorship of the proletariat," even if democratic in form, if it undertook centrally to direct the economic system, would probably destroy personal freedom as completely as any autocracy has ever done.

[译文]
> 然而我们的论点并非独裁必然会根除自由，而是计划必然导向独裁——因为独裁是进行强制和贯彻理想的最有效工具，因此对于大规模中央计划的实现是必不可少的。计划与民主的冲突根源很简单：民主是对经济活动指导所必需的自由压制的一种障碍。但一旦民主不再是个人自由的保证，它完全可能在极权制度下以某种形式持续存在。一个真正的\"无产阶级专政\"，即使保持民主的形式，若要进行经济体系的集中指导，也会像任何专制统治一样彻底摧毁个人自由。<!-- p4.s6 -->

[原文]
> The fashionable concentration on democracy as the main value threatened is not without danger. It is largely responsible for the misleading and unfounded belief that, so long as the ultimate source of power is the will of the majority, the power cannot be arbitrary. The false assurance which many people derive from this belief is an important cause of the general unawareness of the dangers which we face. There is no justification for the belief that, so long as power is conferred by democratic procedure, it cannot be arbitrary; the contrast suggested by this statement is altogether false: it is not the source but the limitation of power which prevents it from being arbitrary. Democratic control may prevent power from becoming arbitrary, but it does not do so by its mere existence. If democracy resolves on a task which necessarily involves the use of power which cannot be guided by fixed rules, it must become arbitrary power.

[译文]
> 当今对民主作为受威胁主要价值的过度关注是有危害的。它在很大程度上造就了一种误导而无根据的信念：只要权力的最终源头是多数人的意愿，权力就无法成为专断的。许多人从这种虚假的确定感中获得的错误的安全保证，是我们对当前面临的危险普遍缺乏认识的重要原因。相信\"只要权力通过民主程序赋予就无法成为专断的\"是没有正当理由的；这种说法暗示的对比完全是错误的：防止权力成为专断的不是权力的来源，而是对权力的限制。民主控制可能防止权力变成专断的，但仅凭民主制度的存在本身是做不到的。若民主制度决议执行一项必然涉及无法用既定规则指导的权力运用的任务，那么这种权力必然会成为专断的。<!-- p4.s7 -->

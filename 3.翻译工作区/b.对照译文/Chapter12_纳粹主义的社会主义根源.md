# The Socialist Roots of Nazism
# 纳粹主义的社会主义根源

> 所有反自由主义的势力正在联合对抗一切自由主义。
> 
> —莫埃勒·范登·布鲁克

> 摘要：本章通过详尽的思想史研究，揭示纳粹主义并非反理性的突然出现，而是欧洲反自由主义思想传统的必然演变，尤其是德国社会主义思想内部的逻辑发展。哈耶克追踪从费希特、拉萨尔的民族主义社会主义，到桑巴特、普伦格、伦施等一战后知识精英的思想演变，论证"保守社会主义"与"国家社会主义"之间的历史连贯性。他警示：正是左翼社会主义者放弃国际主义与民主、拥抱民族主义与权力，使得纳粹主义得以上台。

## 第一节：对"非理性运动"认识的纠正

[原文]
> It is a common mistake to regard National Socialism as a mere revolt against reason, an irrational movement without intellectual background. If that were so, the movement would be much less dangerous than it is. But nothing could be further from the truth or more misleading.

[译文]
> 把国家社会主义仅仅看作反理性的反抗、一场毫无智力基础的运动，这是一种常见的错误。如果真是这样，这场运动远不如现实那样危险。但没有什么比这更远离事实、更具误导性的了。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> The doctrines of National Socialism are the culmination of a long evolution of thought, a process in which thinkers who have had great influence far beyond the confines of Germany have taken part.

[译文]
> 纳粹主义的学说是一个悠久思想演变过程的顶点，这一过程中许多在德国以外范围内有着广泛影响的思想家都参与其中。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> Whatever one may think of the premises from which they started, it cannot be denied that the men who produced the new doctrines were powerful writers who left the impress of their ideas on the whole of European thought. Their system was developed with ruthless consistency. Once one accepts the premises from which it starts, there is no escape from its logic. It is simply collectivism freed from all traces of an individualist tradition which might hamper its realization.

[译文]
> 不管人们如何看待他们的出发点，无可否认的是，这些学说的创造者都是有力的著作家，他们的观点对整个欧洲思想产生了深刻印记。他们的体系建立在无情的逻辑一致性基础之上。一旦接受了他们的出发点，就无法逃脱其逻辑的束缚。说到底，这就是集体主义摆脱了那些可能阻碍其实现的个人主义传统束缚后的真实面目。<!-- p1.s3 -->

---

## 第二节：反自由主义势力的国际根源

[原文]
> Though in this development German thinkers have taken the lead, they were by no means alone. Thomas Carlyle and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Auguste Comte and Georges Sorel, are as much a part of that continuous development as any Germans.

[译文]
> 虽然在这一思想演变中德国思想家处于领先地位，但他们并非孤立无援。托马斯·卡莱尔和休斯顿·斯图尔特·张伯伦、奥古斯特·孔德和乔治·索雷尔，与任何德国人一样都是这一连贯演变的组成部分。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> The development of this strand of thought within Germany has been well traced recently by R. D. Butler in his study of The Roots of National Socialism. But, although its persistence there through a hundred and fifty years in almost unchanged and ever recurring form, which emerges from that study, is rather frightening, it is easy to exaggerate the importance these ideas had in Germany before 1914.

[译文]
> R. D. 巴特勒最近在他的《国家社会主义的根源》一书中很好地追踪了这一思想在德国的发展。但是，虽然那项研究所揭示的这股思想的持久性——在一百五十年间几乎以不变的形式循环出现——确实令人担忧，但人们容易过分夸大这些思想在1914年前对德国的重要性。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> They were only one strand of thought among a people then perhaps more varied in its views than any other. And they were on the whole represented by a small minority and held in as great contempt by the majority of Germans as they were in other countries.

[译文]
> 这些思想只是当时也许比任何其他民族思想更具多元性的人民中思想的一个方面。它们总体上只被一个少数派所代表，并且遭到了德国大多数人的蔑视，就像在其他国家一样。<!-- p2.s3 -->

---

## 第三节：社会主义阵营对纳粹上台的贡献

[原文]
> What, then, caused these views held by a reactionary minority finally to gain the support of the great majority of Germans and practically the whole of her youth? It was not merely the defeat, the suffering, and the wave of nationalism which led to their success.

[译文]
> 那么，是什么导致这些由反动少数派坚持的观点最终获得了绝大多数德国人，甚至实际上德国全部青年的支持呢？这不仅仅是战争的失败、人民的苦难和民族主义浪潮。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> Still less was the cause, as so many people wish to believe, a capitalist reaction against the advance of socialism. On the contrary, the support which brought these ideas to power came precisely from the socialist camp.

[译文]
> 更不是许多人想相信的那样——资本主义对社会主义进步的反动。恰恰相反，将这些思想推上权力宝座的支持力量正好来自社会主义阵营。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> It was certainly not through the bourgeoisie, but rather through the absence of a strong bourgeoisie, that they were helped to power.

[译文]
> 正是通过资产阶级的缺失，而不是资产阶级的力量，这些思想才获得了权力。<!-- p3.s3 -->

---

## 第四节：反资本主义的左右统一

[原文]
> The doctrines which had guided the ruling elements in Germany for the past generation were opposed not to the socialism in Marxism but to the liberal elements contained in it, its internationalism and its democracy. And as it became increasingly clear that it was just these elements which formed obstacles to the realization of socialism, the socialists of the Left approached more and more to those of the Right.

[译文]
> 过去一代人来指导德国统治阶层的学说，其反对的不是马克思主义中的社会主义本身，而是其中包含的自由主义要素——它的国际主义和民主性。随着越来越清楚地看到正是这些要素构成了实现社会主义的障碍，左翼社会主义者与右翼社会主义者的立场日益接近。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> It was the union of the anticapitalist forces of the Right and of the Left, the fusion of radical and conservative socialism, which drove out from Germany everything that was liberal.

[译文]
> 正是反资本主义的右翼和左翼势力的联合，是激进社会主义与保守社会主义的融合，将一切自由主义的东西都驱赶出了德国。<!-- p4.s2 -->

---

## 第五节：民族社会主义的思想根源

[原文]
> The connection between socialism and nationalism in Germany was close from the beginning. It is significant that the most important ancestors of National Socialism—Fichte, Rodbertus, and Lassalle—are at the same time acknowledged fathers of socialism.

[译文]
> 社会主义与民族主义在德国的联系从一开始就很密切。值得注意的是，国家社会主义最重要的先驱者——费希特、罗德贝尔图斯和拉萨尔——同时也被公认为社会主义的奠基人。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> While theoretical socialism in its Marxist form was directing the German labor movement, the authoritarian and nationalist element receded for a time into the background. But not for long. From 1914 onward there arose from the ranks of Marxist socialism one teacher after another who led, not the conservatives and reactionaries, but the hardworking laborer and idealist youth into the National Socialist fold.

[译文]
> 虽然理论上的社会主义以其马克思主义形式指导着德国工人运动，但专制主义和民族主义要素在一段时间内退到了后台。但这种情况并未持续很久。从1914年起，马克思主义社会主义阵营中相继出现了一位又一位的思想家，他们不是领导了保守派和反动派，而是将辛勤劳动的工人和理想主义青年领入了国家社会主义的行列。<!-- p5.s2 -->

[原文]
> It was only thereafter that the tide of nationalist socialism attained major importance and rapidly grew into the Hitlerian doctrine. The war hysteria of 1914, which, just because of the German defeat, was never fully cured, is the beginning of the modern development which produced National Socialism, and it was largely with the assistance of old socialists that it rose during this period.

[译文]
> 此后，民族社会主义浪潮才获得了主要地位，并迅速发展成为了希特勒的学说。1914年的战争歇斯底里症，也正因为德国的失败而从未完全治愈，这是导致国家社会主义现代发展的起点。在这一时期它在很大程度上是得到了老社会主义者的协助才兴起的。<!-- p5.s3 -->

---

## 第六节：桑巴特的战争思想

[原文]
> Perhaps the first, and in some ways the most characteristic, representative of this development is the late Professor Werner Sombart, whose notorious Händler und Helden ("Merchants and Heroes") appeared in 1915.

[译文]
> 也许第一个、在某些方面也是最具代表性的这一发展的代表人物是已故的维尔纳·桑巴特教授，他那臭名昭著的《商人与英雄》一书于1915年出版。<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> Sombart had begun as a Marxian socialist and, as late as 1909, could assert with pride that he had devoted the greater part of his life to fighting for the ideas of Karl Marx. He had done as much as any man to spread socialist ideas and anticapitalist resentment of varying shades throughout Germany; and if German thought became penetrated with Marxian elements in a way that was true of no other country until the Russian revolution, this was in a large measure due to Sombart.

[译文]
> 桑巴特最初是作为一个马克思主义社会主义者开始他的学术生涯的，甚至到了1909年，他还骄傲地声称自己一生中大部分时间都致力于为卡尔·马克思的思想而奋斗。他在整个德国传播社会主义思想和各种反资本主义情绪方面做了和任何人一样多的工作。如果说德国思想被渗透上了马克思主义要素，达到了其他任何国家在俄国革命之前都没有达到的程度，这在很大程度上应当归功于桑巴特。<!-- p6.s2 -->

---

## 第七节：商业文明与英雄精神的对立

[原文]
> In his war book this old socialist welcomed the "German War" as the inevitable conflict between the commercial civilization of England and the heroic culture of Germany. His contempt for the "commercial" views of the English people, who had lost all warlike instincts, is unlimited.

[译文]
> 这位老社会主义者在他的战争著作中欢迎"德国战争"为英国商业文明与德国英雄文化之间不可避免的冲突。他对已经丧失了一切交战本能的英国人民的"商业"观点的蔑视是无限的。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> Nothing is more contemptible in his eyes than the universal striving after the happiness of the individual; and what he describes as the leading maxim of English morals: be just "that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the land" is to him "the most infamous maxim which has ever been pronounced by a commercial mind."

[译文]
> 在他眼中，没有什么比对个人幸福的普遍追求更令人厌恶的。他所描述的英国道德的首要准则——"人应当彼此公正对待，这样日子才会过得好，寿命才会得以延长"——在他看来是"商业头脑所曾说过的最邪恶的格言"。<!-- p7.s2 -->

---

## 第八节：德国国家观的反个人主义

[原文]
> The "German idea of the state," as formulated by Fichte, Lassalle, and Rodbertus, is that the state is neither founded nor formed by individuals, nor an aggregate of individuals, nor is its purpose to serve any interest of individuals. It is a Volksgemeinschaft in which the individual has no rights but only duties.

[译文]
> "德国国家观"，如费希特、拉萨尔和罗德贝尔图斯所阐述的那样，认为国家既不是由个人建立和形成的，也不是个人的集合，它的目的也不是为了服务任何个人利益。它是一个人民共同体（Volksgemeinschaft），在其中个人没有权利只有义务。<!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> Claims of the individual are always an outcome of the commercial spirit. "The ideas of 1789"—liberty, equality, fraternity—are characteristically commercial ideals which have no other purpose but to secure certain advantages to individuals.

[译文]
> 个人的主张总是商业精神的产物。"1789年的理想"——自由、平等、博爱——是典型的商业理想，其唯一目的就是为个人保障某些利益。<!-- p8.s2 -->

---

## 第九节：普伦格的组织理想

[原文]
> Another German professor arrived at essentially the same ideas in a more moderate and more scholarly, but for that reason even more effective, form. Professor Johann Plenge was as great an authority on Marx as Sombart.

[译文]
> 另一位德国教授以一种更温和、更具学术性，但因此甚至更有效的形式达到了本质相同的观点。约翰·普伦格教授与桑巴特一样，也是马克思方面的一位大权威。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> Among his numerous war publications the most important is a small but at the time widely discussed book with the significant title, 1789 and 1914: The Symbolic Years in the History of the Political Mind. It is devoted to the conflict between the "Ideas of 1789," the ideal of freedom, and the "Ideas of 1914," the ideal of organization.

[译文]
> 在他众多的战争出版物中最重要的是一部篇幅不大但当时被广泛讨论的著作，题目很有表意性：《1789年与1914年：政治思想历史中的象征性年份》。这部著作致力于探讨"1789年的理想"——自由的理想——与"1914年的理想"——组织的理想——之间的冲突。<!-- p9.s2 -->

---

## 第十节：组织作为社会主义的本质

[原文]
> Organization is to him, as to all socialists who derive their socialism from a crude application of scientific ideals to the problems of society, the essence of socialism. It was, as he rightly emphasizes, the root of the socialist movement at its inception in early nineteenth-century France. Marx and Marxism have betrayed this basic idea of socialism by their fanatic but utopian adherence to the abstract idea of freedom.

[译文]
> 对他而言，就像对所有那些将科学理想粗糙地应用于社会问题的社会主义者一样，组织是社会主义的本质。正如他正确强调的那样，它是19世纪初社会主义运动成立之初的根基。马克思和马克思主义通过对抽象自由观念的狂热但乌托邦式的坚持，背离了社会主义的这一基本思想。<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> Only now was the idea of organization again coming into its own, elsewhere, as witnessed by the work of H. G. Wells (by whose Future in America Professor Plenge was profoundly influenced, and whom he describes as one of the outstanding figures of modern socialism), but particularly in Germany, where it is best understood and most fully realized.

[译文]
> 现在组织观念才刚刚重新获得生命力。这在H. G. 威尔斯的著作中可以看到（普伦格教授对威尔斯的《美国的未来》产生了深刻影响，并将他描述为现代社会主义的杰出人物之一），但特别是在德国，其中这一理想被最好地理解和最充分地实现了。<!-- p10.s2 -->

---

## 第十一节：伦施的革命史观

[原文]
> But it was left to an active socialist politician, a member of the Left wing of the social-democratic party in the Reichstag, to develop these ideas most fully and to spread them far and wide. Paul Lensch had already in earlier books described the war as "the flight of the English bourgeoisie before the advance of socialism" and explained how different were the socialist ideal of freedom and the English conception.

[译文]
> 但是，一位活跃的社会主义政治家，一位在帝国议会中社会民主党左翼的成员，却最充分地发展了这些思想并广泛传播了它们。保罗·伦施早在他先前的著作中就已经把战争描述为"英国资产阶级在社会主义推进面前的逃亡"，并解释了社会主义自由理想与英国观念之间的差异。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> But only in his third and most successful war book, his Three Years of World Revolution, were his characteristic ideas, under the influence of Plenge, to achieve full development.

[译文]
> 但只有在他第三部也是最成功的战争著作——《世界革命的三年》中，在普伦格的影响下，他的特征思想才获得了充分的发展。<!-- p11.s2 -->

---

## 第十二节：俾斯麦的保护主义与工业发展

[原文]
> Lensch bases his argument on an interesting and in many respects accurate historical account of how the adoption of protection by Bismarck had made possible in Germany a development toward that industrial concentration and cartelization which, from his Marxist standpoint, represented a higher state of industrial development.

[译文]
> 伦施以一个有趣的并在许多方面是准确的历史叙述作为他论证的基础。他说明了俾斯麦采取保护主义政策如何使德国的工业集中和卡特尔化成为可能，从他的马克思主义观点来看，这代表了工业发展的一个更高阶段。<!-- p12.s1 -->

---

## 第十三节：德国作为历史的革命代表

[原文]
> "The result of Bismarck's decision of the year 1879 was that Germany took on the role of the revolutionary; that is to say, of a state whose position in relation to the rest of the world is that of a representative of a higher and more advanced economic system. Having realized this, we should perceive that in the present World Revolution Germany represents the revolutionary, and her greatest antagonist, England, the counter-revolutionary side."

[译文]
> "俾斯麦1879年决议的结果是德国承担了革命者的角色，也就是说，是一个在与世界其余地方的关系中代表一个更高和更先进的经济体系的国家。一旦认识到这一点，我们应该察觉到在现在的世界革命中德国代表革命的一方，而她最大的对手英国代表反革命的一方。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> This fact proves how little the constitution of a country, whether it be liberal and republican or monarchic and autocratic, affects the question whether, from the point of view of historical development, that country is to be regarded as liberal or not.

[译文]
> 这个事实表明一个国家的制度——无论是自由民主制还是君主专制制——对于从历史发展的角度说该国是应该被看作革命的还是反革命的这个问题的影响是多么之小。<!-- p13.s2 -->

---

## 第十四节：社会民主党的民族化

[原文]
> Since the Social Democrats, by the aid of this [universal] Suffrage, occupied every post which they could obtain in the Reichstag, the State Parliament, the municipal councils, the courts for the settlement of trade disputes, the sick funds, and so forth, they penetrated very deeply into the organism of the state; but the price which they had to pay for this was that the state, in its turn, exercised a profound influence upon the working classes.

[译文]
> 由于社会民主党借助普遍选举权，占据了他们能在帝国议会、州议会、市议会、贸易争议解决法庭、病人基金等处获得的每一个职位，他们深深地渗透到了国家的肌体中。但他们为此付出的代价是国家反过来对工人阶级产生了深刻的影响。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> To be sure, as the result of strenuous socialistic labors for fifty years, the state is no longer the same as it was in the year 1867, when universal suffrage first came into operation; but then, Social Democracy, in its turn, is no longer the same as it was at the time. The state has undergone a process of socialization, and Social Democracy has undergone a process of nationalization.

[译文]
> 确实，作为五十年来辛苦的社会主义劳动的结果，国家已经不再是它在1867年、普遍选举权第一次付诸实行时的那个样子了。但反过来，社会民主党也不再是它那时的样子了。国家经历了一个社会主义化的过程，而社会民主党经历了一个民族主义化的过程。<!-- p14.s2 -->

---

## 第十五节：斯宾格勒对普鲁士精神的重新阐释

[原文]
> Plenge and Lensch in turn have provided the leading ideas for the immediate masters of National Socialism, particularly Oswald Spengler and Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, to mention only the two best-known names.

[译文]
> 普伦格和伦施反过来为国家社会主义的直接大师们，特别是奥斯瓦尔德·斯宾格勒和亚瑟·莫埃勒·范登·布鲁克，仅提及两个最著名的名字，提供了主要思想。<!-- p15.s1 -->

[原文]
> "Old Prussian spirit and socialist conviction, which today hate each other with the hatred of brothers, are one and the same." The representatives of Western civilization in Germany, the German liberals, are "the invisible English army which after the Battle of Jena, Napoleon left behind on German soil."

[译文]
> "古老的普鲁士精神和社会主义信念，现在以'兄弟般的憎恨'相互仇视，它们是一个而且同一个。"德国西方文明的代表——德国自由主义者——是"看不见的英国军队，它在耶拿战役之后、拿破仑留在了德国土地上的。"<!-- p15.s2 -->

---

## 第十六节：普鲁士理想与官僚国家

[原文]
> "In Prussia there existed a real state in the most ambitious meaning of the word. There could be, strictly speaking, no private persons. Everybody who lived within the system that worked with the precision of a clockwork, was in some way a link in it."

[译文]
> "在普鲁士存在着一个真正的国家，以最雄心勃勃的字义。严格来说，不可能存在私人。每一个生活在这个运行起来像精密钟表一样的体系中的人，在某种方式上都是其中的一个环节。"<!-- p16.s1 -->

[原文]
> The "Prussian idea" requires that everybody should become a state official—that all wages and salaries be fixed by the state. The administration of all property, in particular, becomes a salaried function. The state of the future will be a Beamtenstaat.

[译文]
> "普鲁士理想"要求每一个人都成为一个国家官员——所有工资都由国家规定。所有财产的管理，特别是，变成了一个有薪的职能。未来的国家将是一个官僚国家（Beamtenstaat）。<!-- p16.s2 -->

---

## 第十七节：莫埃勒与第三帝国的宗旨

[原文]
> It was only a step from this for the patron saint of National Socialism, Moeller van den Bruck, to proclaim World War I a war between liberalism and socialism: "We have lost the war against the West. Socialism has lost it against Liberalism."

[译文]
> 对于国家社会主义的主保护人莫埃勒·范登·布鲁克来说，距离只有一步之遥，他就宣布第一次世界大战是自由主义与社会主义之间的战争："我们输掉了对西方的战争。社会主义失败了与自由主义的战争。"<!-- p17.s1 -->

[原文]
> As with Spengler, liberalism is, therefore, the archenemy. Moeller van den Bruck glories in the fact that "there are no liberals in Germany today; there are young revolutionaries, there are young conservatives. But who would be a liberal?"

[译文]
> 就像对于斯宾格勒一样，自由主义因此是死敌。莫埃勒·范登·布鲁克为此而沾沾自喜："今天德国没有自由主义者；有年轻的革命者，有年轻的保守派。但谁会是一个自由主义者呢？"<!-- p17.s2 -->

---

## 第十八节：左右势力的共同敌人

[原文]
> Fight against liberalism in all its forms, liberalism that had defeated Germany, was the common idea which united socialists and conservatives in one common front. At first it was mainly in the German Youth Movement, almost entirely socialist in inspiration and outlook, where these ideas were most readily accepted and the fusion of socialism and nationalism completed.

[译文]
> 对自由主义的各种形式的战争，对击败了德国的自由主义的战争，是联合了社会主义者和保守派在一个共同战线上的共同思想。起初这些观念主要是在德国青年运动中获得了最容易的接纳，这个运动几乎完全是在社会主义的启发和展望下进行的，社会主义与民族主义的融合也由此完成。<!-- p18.s1 -->

---

## 第十九节："保守社会主义"的兴起

[原文]
> In the later twenties and until the advent to power of Hitler a circle of young men gathered round the journal Die Tat and, led by Ferdinand Fried, became the chief exponent of this tradition in the intellectual sphere. Fried's Ende des Kapitalismus is perhaps the most characteristic product of this group of Edelnazis, as they were known in Germany.

[译文]
> 在二十世纪二十年代后期直到希特勒掌权为止，一群年轻人围绕期刊《行动》（Die Tat）聚集起来，并在费迪南德·弗里德的领导下，在智识领域成为了这一传统的首席倡导者。弗里德的《资本主义的终结》大概是这个被称为"高尚纳粹分子"（Edelnazis）的群体的最具代表性的产物。<!-- p19.s1 -->

[原文]
> "Conservative Socialism" (and, in other circles, "Religious Socialism") was the slogan under which a large number of writers prepared the atmosphere in which "National Socialism" succeeded.

[译文]
> "保守社会主义"（在其他圈子中则是"宗教社会主义"）是一个标语，大量的著作家都在它的旗帜下为"国家社会主义"成功所需的氛围做准备。<!-- p19.s2 -->

---

## 第二十节：观点总结与警示

[原文]
> It is "conservative socialism" which is the dominant trend among us now. Had the war against the Western powers "with the weapons of the spirit and of economic organization" not almost succeeded before the real war began?

[译文]
> 这是"保守社会主义"，现在是我们之中的主导趋势。如果"用精神和经济组织的武器"对西方强国的战争在真正的战争开始前没有差一点就成功，又会怎样呢？<!-- p20.s1 -->

---

# Why the Worst Get on Top
# 为什么坏人最容易上台

> 摘要：本章深入分析极权主义权力结构的必然性，阐明为何极权制度往往由不道德的人掌权。哈耶克论证，一个由集体主义原则管理的社会必然倾向于选择那些无道德底线的个人担任领导，因为绝对权力与绝对支配要求统治者放弃个人的道德信念。他剖析了集体主义的"道德性"如何从关心人类福祉转变为只追求权力，以及这种转变如何必然导致极权主义的最黑暗特征。

## 第一节：对历史偶然性的幻觉

[原文]
> Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
> —Lord Acton

[译文]
> 权力倾向于腐蚀人性，绝对权力绝对腐蚀人性。——阿克顿勋爵<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> We must now examine a belief from which many who regard the advent of totalitarianism as inevitable derive consolation and which seriously weakens the resistance of many others who would oppose it with all their might if they fully apprehended its nature. It is the belief that the most repellent features of the totalitarian regimes are due to the historical accident that they were established by groups of blackguards and thugs.

[译文]
> 现在我们必须审视一种信念，许多把极权主义的来临视为不可避免的人从中获得安慰，而这种信念也严重削弱了那些本可能全力反对极权主义、却未能充分领会其本质的人的抵抗力。这种信念是：极权政权最令人厌恶的特征是由一个历史上的偶然事件造成的——它们由一帮流氓和恶棍建立。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> Surely, it is argued, if in Germany the creation of a totalitarian regime brought the Streichers and Killingers, the Leys and Heines, the Himmlers and Heydrichs to power, this may prove the viciousness of the German character but not that the rise of such people is the necessary consequence of a totalitarian system. Why should it not be possible that the same sort of system, if it be necessary to achieve important ends, be run by decent people for the good of the community as a whole?

[译文]
> 人们辩称，如果在德国建立极权政权导致施特赖歇尔和基林格、莱伊和海因斯、希姆莱和海德里希这样的人掌权，这也许能证明德国人性格的邪恶，但不能证明这样的人上台是极权体系的必然后果。为什么不可能用相同的体系——如果这对实现重要目标是必要的——由正派的人为了整个社区的共同善而管理呢？<!-- p1.s3 -->

---

## 第二节：专制的美德与体系的悖论

[原文]
> We must not deceive ourselves into believing that all good people must be democrats or will necessarily wish to have a share in the government. Many, no doubt, would rather entrust it to somebody whom they think more competent. Although this might be unwise, there is nothing bad or dishonorable in approving a dictatorship of the good.

[译文]
> 我们不能欺骗自己，认为所有好人必然是民主主义者或一定希望在政府中有份。无疑，许多人更愿意将其托付给他们认为更有能力的人。虽然这可能不够明智，但赞成由好人统治的专制并没有什么坏的或不名誉的。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> Totalitarianism, we can already hear it argued, is a powerful system alike for good and evil, and the purpose for which it will be used depends entirely on the dictators. And those who think that it is not the system which we need fear, but the danger that it might be run by bad men, might even be tempted to forestall this danger by seeing that it is established in time by good men.

[译文]
> 人们已经可以辩称，极权主义是一个既可用于善也可用于恶的强大体系，它将被用于什么目的完全取决于独裁者。那些认为我们需要害怕的不是体系本身，而是它可能被坏人掌管的危险的人，甚至可能会试图通过及时确保由好人建立来预防这种危险。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> No doubt an American or English "Fascist" system would greatly differ from the Italian or German models; no doubt, if the transition were effected without violence, we might expect to get a better type of leader. And, if I had to live under a Fascist system, I have no doubt that I would rather live under one run by Englishmen or Americans than under one run by anybody else.

[译文]
> 无疑，美国或英国式的"法西斯"体系会与意大利或德国的模式大不相同；无疑，如果转变能够无暴力进行，我们可能期待获得更好类型的领导者。如果我必须活在法西斯体系下，我毫不怀疑我更愿意活在由英国人或美国人管理的体系下，而不是由任何其他人管理的体系下。<!-- p2.s3 -->

---

## 第三节：必然性与道德沦陷

[原文]
> Yet all this does not mean that, judged on our present standards, our Fascist system would in the end prove so very different or much less intolerable than its prototypes. There are strong reasons for believing that what to us appear the worst features of the existing totalitarian systems are not accidental by-products but phenomena which totalitarianism is certain sooner or later to produce.

[译文]
> 然而这一切并不意味着，按照我们目前的标准判断，我们的法西斯体系最终证明会与其原型差异很大或容忍度高很多。有充分的理由相信，我们看来最坏的现存极权体系特征并非偶然产物，而是极权主义必然迟早会产生的现象。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> Just as the democratic statesman who sets out to plan economic life will soon be confronted with the alternative of either assuming dictatorial powers or abandoning his plans, so the totalitarian dictator would soon have to choose between disregard of ordinary morals and failure. It is for this reason that the unscrupulous and uninhibited are likely to be more successful in a society tending toward totalitarianism.

[译文]
> 正如设定计划经济的民主政治家很快就会面临要么假定独裁权力要么放弃计划的选择，极权独裁者也很快就必须在无视普通道德和失败之间做出选择。正因为这个原因，无原则和无所不为的人更可能在倾向于极权主义的社会中更成功。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> Who does not see this has not yet grasped the full width of the gulf which separates totalitarianism from a liberal regime, the utter difference between the whole moral atmosphere under collectivism and the essentially individualist Western civilization.

[译文]
> 看不到这一点的人还没有认识到将极权主义与自由制度分开的鸿沟的全部宽度，以及集体主义下的整个道德氛围与本质上是个人主义的西方文明之间的彻底差异。<!-- p3.s3 -->

---

## 第四节：集体主义的道德悖论

[原文]
> The "moral basis of collectivism" has, of course, been much debated in the past; but what concerns us here is not its moral basis but its moral results. The usual discussions of the ethical aspects of collectivism refer to the question whether collectivism is demanded by existing moral convictions; or what moral convictions would be required if collectivism is to produce the hoped-for results.

[译文]
> 集体主义的"道德基础"当然在过去经历了很多辩论；但关乎我们的不是其道德基础而是其道德结果。对集体主义伦理方面的通常讨论涉及这样的问题：集体主义是否由现存的道德信念所要求；或如果集体主义要产生期望的结果，需要什么样的道德信念。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> Our question, however, is what moral views will be produced by a collectivist organization of society, or what views are likely to rule it. The interaction between morals and institutions may well have the effect that the ethics produced by collectivism will be altogether different from the moral ideals that lead to the demand for collectivism.

[译文]
> 然而我们的问题是，什么样的道德观点会由集体主义社会组织产生，或什么样的观点可能对其起统治作用。道德与制度之间的相互作用很可能产生这样的效果：由集体主义产生的伦理将与导致对集体主义的要求的道德理想完全不同。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> While we are likely to think that, since the desire for a collectivist system springs from high moral motives, such a system must be the breeding-ground for the highest virtues, there is, in fact, no reason why any system should necessarily enhance those attitudes which serve the purpose for which it was designed.

[译文]
> 虽然我们可能认为，既然对集体主义体系的渴望源于崇高的道德动机，这样的体系必然是最高品德的孳生地，但事实上，没有理由认为任何体系必然会增强那些为其设计目的服务的态度。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> The ruling moral views will depend partly on the qualities that will lead individuals to success in a collectivist or totalitarian system and partly on the requirements of the totalitarian machinery.

[译文]
> 统治性的道德观点将部分取决于导致个人在集体主义或极权体系中成功的品质，部分取决于极权机器的要求。<!-- p4.s4 -->

---

## 第五节：制度设计与权力集中

[原文]
> We must here return for a moment to the position which precedes the suppression of democratic institutions and the creation of a totalitarian regime. In this stage it is the general demand for quick and determined government action that is the dominating element in the situation, dissatisfaction with the slow and cumbersome course of democratic procedure which makes action for action's sake the goal.

[译文]
> 在这里我们必须暂时回到先于民主制度的压制和极权政权的创建的位置。在这个阶段，对迅速和果断的政府行动的普遍要求是形势中的支配元素，对民主程序的缓慢和笨重进程的不满使得行动本身成为目标。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is then the man or the party who seems strong and resolute enough "to get things done" who exercises the greatest appeal. "Strong" in this sense means not merely a numerical majority—it is the ineffectiveness of parliamentary majorities with which people are dissatisfied. What they will seek is somebody with such solid support as to inspire confidence that he can carry out whatever he wants.

[译文]
> 正是那个看起来足够强大和坚定能"完成事情"的人或政党行使最大的吸引力。这种意义上的"强大"不仅仅意味着数字上的多数——人们不满的是议会多数的无效性。他们要寻求的是某个具有如此坚实支持的人，以激发信心他能执行任何他想做的事。<!-- p5.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is here that the new type of party, organized on military lines, comes in. In the Central European countries the socialist parties had familiarized the masses with political organizations of a semi-military character designed to absorb as much as possible of the private life of the members.

[译文]
> 正是在这里，按军事路线组织的新型政党出现了。在中欧国家，社会主义政党已使群众熟悉了具有半军事特征的政治组织，其设计目的是尽可能多地吸收成员的私生活。<!-- p5.s3 -->

[原文]
> All that was wanted to give one group overwhelming power was to carry the same principle somewhat further, to seek strength not in the assured votes of huge numbers at occasional elections but in the absolute and unreserved support of a smaller but more thoroughly organized body. The chance of imposing a totalitarian regime on a whole people depends on the leader's first collecting round him a group which is prepared voluntarily to submit to that totalitarian discipline which they are to impose by force upon the rest.

[译文]
> 要给一个群体压倒性的权力所需的一切是将相同的原则推进得更远，不是在临时选举中从大量人的有把握的投票中寻求力量，而是在一个更小但组织更彻底的机体的绝对和无保留的支持中寻求力量。对整个人民强加极权政权的机会取决于领导者首先在其身边聚集一个群体，这个群体准备自愿服从他们要强制强加于其他人的那种极权纪律。<!-- p5.s4 -->

---

## 第六节：社会主义者的两难与无原则者的优势

[原文]
> Although the socialist parties had the strength to get anything if they had cared to use force, they were reluctant to do so. They had, without knowing it, set themselves a task which only the ruthless ready to disregard the barriers of accepted morals can execute.

[译文]
> 虽然社会主义政党有力量如果他们愿意使用武力就能得到任何东西，他们不愿这样做。他们在不知不觉中为自己设定了一个任务，只有准备无视公认道德障碍的无情者才能执行。<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> That socialism can be put into practice only by methods which most socialists disapprove is, of course, a lesson learned by many social reformers in the past. The old socialist parties were inhibited by their democratic ideals; they did not possess the ruthlessness required for the performance of their chosen task.

[译文]
> 社会主义只能通过大多数社会主义者不赞成的方法付诸实践，这当然是过去许多社会改革者学到的一课。旧社会主义党受其民主理想的束缚；他们不具备执行其选定任务所需的无情。<!-- p6.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is characteristic that both in Germany and in Italy the success of fascism was preceded by the refusal of the socialist parties to take over the responsibilities of government. They were unwilling wholeheartedly to employ the methods to which they had pointed the way. They still hoped for the miracle of a majority's agreeing on a particular plan for the organization of the whole of society; others had already learned the lesson that in a planned society the question can no longer be on what do a majority of the people agree but what the largest single group is whose members agree sufficiently to make unified direction of all affairs possible.

[译文]
> 特别的是，在德国和意大利，法西斯主义的成功都被社会主义政党拒绝承担政府责任所先行。他们不愿意全心全意地采用他们所指向的方法。他们仍然希望大多数人同意某个组织整个社会的特定计划的奇迹；其他人已经学到了这样的教训，在计划社会中，问题不再是大多数人同意什么，而是最大的单一群体是哪个，其成员同意到足以使所有事务的统一方向成为可能的程度。<!-- p6.s3 -->

---

## 第七节：同质性与选择的必然

[原文]
> There are three main reasons why such a numerous and strong group with fairly homogeneous views is not likely to be formed by the best but rather by the worst elements of any society. By our standards the principles on which such a group would be selected will be almost entirely negative.

[译文]
> 有三个主要原因为什么这样一个众多且强大的、观点相当同质的群体不太可能由任何社会的最好分子而是由最坏分子形成。按我们的标准，这样一个群体将被选择的原则将几乎完全是消极的。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> In the first instance, it is probably true that, in general, the higher the education and intelligence of individuals become, the more their views and tastes are differentiated and the less likely they are to agree on a particular hierarchy of values. It is a corollary of this that if we wish to find a high degree of uniformity and similarity of outlook, we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive and "common" instincts and tastes prevail.

[译文]
> 首先，一般而言个人的教育和智力越高，他们的观点和品味就越分化，越不可能在特定的价值等级上一致，这在概率上可能是真实的。这的一个推论是，如果我们希望找到高度的一致性和展望相似性，我们必须下降到更原始的道德和智力标准的区域，那里更原始和"普遍"的本能和品味盛行。<!-- p7.s2 -->

[原文]
> This does not mean that the majority of people have low moral standards; it merely means that the largest group of people whose values are very similar are the people with low standards. It is, as it were, the lowest common denominator which unites the largest number of people. If a numerous group is needed, strong enough to impose their views on the values of life on all the rest, it will never be those with highly differentiated and developed tastes—it will be those who form the "mass" in the derogatory sense of the term, the least original and independent, who will be able to put the weight of their numbers behind their particular ideals.

[译文]
> 这并不意味着大多数人有低道德标准；它仅仅意味着价值观非常相似的最大人群是有低标准的人。它就像是，最小的共同分母，团结了最多的人。如果需要一个众多的群体，足够强大以将他们关于生活价值的观点强加于所有其他人，它永远不会是那些有高度分化和发达品味的人——它将是那些形成术语贬低意义上"大众"的人，最不原始和独立的人，他们将能够把他们数量的分量放在他们特定理想的后面。<!-- p7.s3 -->

---

## 第八节：灌输与容易操纵

[原文]
> If, however, a potential dictator had to rely entirely on those whose uncomplicated and primitive instincts happen to be very similar, their number would scarcely give sufficient weight to their endeavors. He will have to increase their numbers by converting more to the same simple creed.

[译文]
> 然而，如果一个潜在的独裁者不得不完全依赖那些其单纯的和原始本能恰好非常相似的人，他们的数量几乎不会给他的努力充分的分量。他将不得不通过使更多人皈依同样简单的信条来增加他们的数量。<!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> Here comes in the second negative principle of selection: he will be able to obtain the support of all the docile and gullible, who have no strong convictions of their own but are prepared to accept a ready-made system of values if it is only drummed into their ears sufficiently loudly and frequently. It will be those whose vague and imperfectly formed ideas are easily swayed and whose passions and emotions are readily aroused who will thus swell the ranks of the totalitarian party.

[译文]
> 在这里，选择的第二个消极原则出现了：他将能够获得所有顺从和易骗的人的支持，他们没有自己的强烈信念，但如果某种现成的价值体系被充分大声和频繁地灌进他们的耳朵，他们就准备接受。那些模糊和不完全形成的观点容易被摇摆、其激情和情感容易被激起的人将因此填补极权党的行列。<!-- p8.s2 -->

---

## 第九节：仇恨的团结力量

[原文]
> It is in connection with the deliberate effort of the skillful demagogue to weld together a closely coherent and homogeneous body of supporters that the third and perhaps most important negative element of selection enters. It seems to be almost a law of human nature that it is easier for people to agree on a negative program—on the hatred of an enemy, on the envy of those better off— than on any positive task.

[译文]
> 正是在熟练的煽动者刻意努力将紧密连贯和同质的支持者团体焊接在一起的联系中，第三个也许最重要的选择的消极元素进入。似乎几乎是人性的一条法则，人们更容易在消极计划上一致——对敌人的仇恨，对比自己更好的人的嫉妒——而不是在任何积极任务上。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> The contrast between the "we" and the "they," the common fight against those outside the group, seems to be an essential ingredient in any creed which will solidly knit together a group for common action. It is consequently always employed by those who seek, not merely support of a policy, but the unreserved allegiance of huge masses. From their point of view it has the great advantage of leaving them greater freedom of action than almost any positive program. The enemy, whether he be internal, like the "Jew" or the "kulak," or external, seems to be an indispensable requisite in the armory of a totalitarian leader.

[译文]
> "我们"与"他们"之间的对比，对那些在群体外的人的共同斗争，似乎是任何将一个群体紧密团结在一起进行共同行动的信条中的一个必要成分。因此它总是被那些寻求不仅仅是对一项政策的支持，而是对巨大群众的无保留效忠的人采用。从他们的角度看，它具有给他们比几乎任何积极计划更大的行动自由的巨大优势。敌人，无论是内部的如"犹太人"或"富农"，还是外部的，似乎是极权领导人军火库中的一个不可或缺的必需品。<!-- p9.s2 -->

---

## 第十节：反资本主义与民族主义的根源

[原文]
> That in Germany it was the Jew who became the enemy until his place was taken by the "plutocracies" was no less a result of the anticapitalist resentment on which the whole movement was based than the selection of the kulak in Russia. In Germany and Austria the Jew had come to be regarded as the representative of capitalism because a traditional dislike of large classes of the population for commercial pursuits had left these more readily accessible to a group that was practically excluded from the more highly esteemed occupations.

[译文]
> 在德国，犹太人成为敌人直到其位置被"富豪"取代，这与俄罗斯中库拉克的选择一样，是整个运动所基于的反资本主义怨恨的结果。在德国和奥地利，犹太人开始被视为资本主义的代表，因为大量人口对商业活动的传统厌恶使这些更容易被实际上被排除在更受重视职业之外的群体所接触。<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is the old story of the alien race's being admitted only to the less respected trades and then being hated still more for practicing them. The fact that German anti-Semitism and anticapitalism spring from the same root is of great importance for the understanding of what has happened there, but this is rarely grasped by foreign observers.

[译文]
> 这是外来种族只被允许从事不太受尊重的贸易，然后因为从事它们而被更仇恨的老故事。德国反犹太主义和反资本主义源于同一根源这一事实对理解那里发生的事情至关重要，但这很少被外国观察家掌握。<!-- p10.s2 -->

---

## 第十一节：集体主义的必然民族主义

[原文]
> To treat the universal tendency of collectivist policy to become nationalistic as due entirely to the necessity for securing unhesitating support would be to neglect another and no less important factor. It may, indeed, be questioned whether anyone can realistically conceive of a collectivist program other than in the service of a limited group, whether collectivism can exist in any form other than that of some kind of particularism, be it nationalism, racialism, or classism.

[译文]
> 将集体主义政策变得民族主义的普遍倾向完全视为确保毫不犹豫的支持的必要性将忽视另一个同样重要的因素。人们可能确实质疑任何人是否能现实地构思一个除了为有限群体的服务之外的集体主义计划，集体主义是否能以除了某种特殊主义的形式，无论是民族主义、种族主义还是阶级主义之外的任何形式存在。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> The belief in the community of aims and interests with fellow-men seems to presuppose a greater degree of similarity of outlook and thought than exists between men merely as human beings. If the other members of one's group cannot all be personally known, they must at least be of the same kind as those around us, think and talk in the same way and about the same kind of things, in order that we may identify ourselves with them.

[译文]
> 对与同胞的目标和利益共同体的信念似乎预设了比仅作为人类存在的人之间存在的更大程度的展望和思想相似性。如果一个人群体的其他成员不能都被个人认识，他们至少必须与我们周围的人类似，以相同的方式思考和谈话，以及关于相同类型的事情，以便我们能够与他们认同自己。<!-- p11.s2 -->

[原文]
> Collectivism on a world scale seems to be unthinkable—except in the service of a small ruling élite. It would certainly raise not only technical but, above all, moral problems which none of our socialists is willing to face. If the English proletarian, for instance, is entitled to an equal share of the income now derived from his country's capital resources, and of the control of their use, because they are the result of exploitation, so on the same principle all the Indians would be entitled not only to the income from but also to the use of a proportional share of the British capital.

[译文]
> 世界规模上的集体主义似乎是不可思议的——除了服从于一个小的统治精英。它当然会提出不仅仅是技术的而且首先是道德问题，我们的社会主义者都不愿意面对。例如，如果英国无产者有权获得现在来自其国家资本资源的收入的平等份额，以及对其使用的控制，因为它们是剥削的结果，那么按照同样的原则，所有印度人不仅应有权获得，而且应有权使用英国资本的相应份额。<!-- p11.s3 -->

---

## 第十二节：社会主义者的尴尬与不一致

[原文]
> But what socialists seriously contemplate the equal division of existing capital resources among the people of the world? They all regard the capital as belonging not to humanity but to the nation—though even within the nation few would dare to advocate that the richer regions should be deprived of some of "their" capital equipment in order to help the poorer regions. What socialists proclaim as a duty toward the fellow-members of the existing states they are not prepared to grant to the foreigner.

[译文]
> 但哪个社会主义者会认真考虑对世界人民平等分配现存资本资源？他们都将资本视为属于国家而不是人类——虽然即使在国家内，也很少有人敢于倡导应该剥夺较富裕地区的某些"他们的"资本设备以帮助较贫穷地区。社会主义者宣称对现有国家的同胞的责任，他们不准备授予外国人。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> From a consistent collectivist point of view the claims of the "have-not" nations for a new division of the world are entirely justified—though, if consistently applied, those who demand it most loudly would lose by it almost as much as the richest nations. They are, therefore, careful not to base their claims on any equalitarian principles but on their pretended superior capacity to organize other peoples.

[译文]
> 从一致的集体主义观点看，"没有"国家对重新分割世界的要求是完全合理的——虽然，如果一致地应用，那些要求最大声的人将因此失去几乎与最富国家一样多。因此，他们小心翼翼地不将他们的要求建立在任何平等主义原则上，而是建立在他们声称对组织其他民族的优越能力上。<!-- p12.s2 -->

---

## 第十三节：集体主义的深层矛盾

[原文]
> One of the inherent contradictions of the collectivist philosophy is that, while basing itself on the humanistic morals which individualism has developed, it is practicable only within a relatively small group. That socialism so long as it remains theoretical is internationalist, while as soon as it is put into practice, whether in Russia or in Germany, it becomes violently nationalist, is one of the reasons why "liberal socialism" as most people in the Western world imagine it is purely theoretical, while the practice of socialism is everywhere totalitarian.

[译文]
> 集体主义哲学的内在矛盾之一是，虽然它基于个人主义已经发展的人文道德，它只能在相对较小的群体内实践。社会主义只要它保持理论就是国际主义者，而一旦它被付诸实践，无论在俄罗斯还是在德国，它就变得猛烈地民族主义，这是为什么大多数西方世界的人所想象的"自由社会主义"纯粹是理论的，而社会主义的实践到处都是极权主义的原因之一。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> Collectivism has no room for the wide humanitarianism of liberalism but only for the narrow particularism of the totalitarian. If the "community" or the state are prior to the individual, if they have ends of their own independent of and superior to those of the individuals, only those individuals who work for the same ends can be regarded as members of the community.

[译文]
> 集体主义没有为自由主义的广泛人道主义腾出空间，只有极权主义的狭隘特殊主义。如果"社区"或国家先于个人，如果它们有独立于个人并优于个人的目标，只有那些为相同目标工作的个人才能被视为社区的成员。<!-- p13.s2 -->

---

## 第十四节：人性与群体认同的本质

[原文]
> It is a necessary consequence of this view that a person is respected only as a member of the group, that is, only if and in so far as he works for the recognized common ends, and that he derives his whole dignity only from this membership and not merely from being a man. Indeed, the very concepts of humanity and therefore of any form of internationalism are entirely products of the individualist view of man, and there can be no place for them in a collectivist system of thought.

[译文]
> 这一观点的必然后果是，一个人只有作为群体的成员才受尊重，也就是说，只有在他为公认的共同目标而工作的范围内，他才受尊重，而且他的全部尊严只来自这种成员资格，而不仅仅来自于他是一个人。实际上，人性的概念本身，因此任何形式的国际主义，完全是个人主义对人的观点的产物，在集体主义思想体系中不能有位置。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> Apart from the basic fact that the community of collectivism can extend only as far as the unity of purpose of the individuals exists or can be created, several contributory factors strengthen the tendency of collectivism to become particularist and exclusive. Of these, one of the most important is that the desire of the individual to identify himself with a group is very frequently the result of a feeling of inferiority and that therefore his want will be satisfied only if membership of the group confers some superiority over outsiders.

[译文]
> 除了集体主义的社区只能在个人的目标一致性存在或能够被创建的范围内延伸这个基本事实外，几个贡献因素加强了集体主义变成特殊主义和独占的倾向。其中，最重要的之一是个人与一个群体认同的欲望非常频繁地是劣等感的结果，因此他的需求只有在群体成员资格赋予对局外人的某种优越性时才会得到满足。<!-- p14.s2 -->

[原文]
> Sometimes, it seems, the very fact that these violent instincts which the individual knows he must curb within the group can be given a free range in the collective action toward the outsider, becomes a further inducement for merging personality in that of the group. There is a profound truth expressed in the title of Reinhold Niebuhr's Moral Man and Immoral Society—however little we can follow him in the conclusions he draws from his thesis.

[译文]
> 有时似乎，这样一个事实：这些个人知道他必须在群体中抑制的暴力本能可以在对局外人的集体行动中被自由发挥，成为个人与群体的人格合并的进一步诱因。莱茵霍尔德·尼布尔的《道德的人与不道德的社会》的标题中表达了深刻的真理——尽管我们很少能追随他从其论文中得出的结论。<!-- p14.s3 -->

---

## 第十五节：道德委托与群体不负责任

[原文]
> There is, indeed, as he says elsewhere, "an increasing tendency among modern men to imagine themselves ethical because they have delegated their vices to larger and larger groups." To act on behalf of a group seems to free people of many of the moral restraints which control their behavior as individuals within the group.

[译文]
> 实际上，如他在其他地方所说的，"现代人中有一种越来越多的倾向，他们想象自己是道德的，因为他们已经把他们的恶行委托给越来越大的群体。"代表一个群体行动似乎使人们摆脱许多控制他们在群体中作为个人的行为的道德约束。<!-- p15.s1 -->

[原文]
> The definitely antagonistic attitude which most planners take toward internationalism is further explained by the fact that in the existing world all outside contacts of a group are obstacles to their effectively planning the sphere in which they can attempt it. It is therefore no accident that, as the editor of one of the most comprehensive collective studies on planning has discovered to his chagrin, "most 'planners' are militant nationalists."

[译文]
> 大多数计划者对国际主义的明确敌对态度进一步得到解释，即在现有世界中，一个群体的所有外部接触对他们有效地计划他们可以尝试的领域是障碍。因此，一个关于计划的最全面集体研究的编辑对他的遗憾发现是偶然的是，"大多数'计划者'是好战的民族主义者。"<!-- p15.s2 -->

---

## 第十六节：韦比夫妇与权力的迷恋

[原文]
> The nationalist and imperialist propensities of socialist planners, much more common than is generally recognized, are not always as flagrant as, for example, in the case of the Webbs and some of the other early Fabians, with whom enthusiasm for planning was characteristically combined with the veneration for the large and powerful political units and a contempt for the small state.

[译文]
> 社会主义计划者的民族主义和帝国主义倾向，比一般认可的要普遍得多，并不总是像例如韦比夫妇和一些其他早期费边社成员一样明显，对于他们来说，对计划的热情特别地与对大的和强大的政治单位的尊敬和对小国的蔑视相结合。<!-- p16.s1 -->

[原文]
> The historian Élie Halévy, speaking of the Webbs when he first knew them forty years ago, records that their socialism was profoundly antiliberal. "They did not hate the Tories, indeed they were extraordinarily lenient to them, but they had no mercy for Gladstonian Liberalism. It was the time of the Boer War and both the advanced liberals and the men who were beginning to form the Labour Party had generously sided with the Boers against British Imperialism, in the name of freedom and humanity. But the two Webbs and their friend, Bernard Shaw, stood apart. They were ostentatiously imperialistic.

[译文]
> 历史学家埃利·哈莱维在谈到他四十年前初识的韦比夫妇时记录说，他们的社会主义是深刻的反自由主义。"他们不恨保守党，实际上他们对他们极其宽恕，但他们对格拉德斯通自由主义毫不留情。那是第二次英布战争的时期，先进的自由主义者和开始组建工党的人都慷慨地支持布尔人反对英国帝国主义，以自由和人道名义。但两个韦比夫妇和他们的朋友伯纳德·肖站在了一边。他们是公然的帝国主义者。<!-- p16.s2 -->

[原文]
> The independence of small nations might mean something to the liberal individualist. It meant nothing to collectivists like themselves. I can still hear Sidney Webb explaining to me that the future belonged to the great administrative nations, where the officials govern and the police keep order." And elsewhere Halévy quotes George Bernard Shaw, arguing, about the same time, that "the world is to the big and powerful states by necessity; and the little ones must come within their border or be crushed out of existence."

[译文]
> 小国的独立对自由主义个人主义者可能意味着什么。对像他们自己这样的集体主义者来说这意味着什么都不是。我仍然可以听到悉尼·韦比向我解释未来属于伟大的行政国家，其中官员统治和警察维持秩序。"而在其他地方，哈莱维引用乔治·伯纳德·肖的话，同时期左右论证，"世界必然属于大的和强大的国家；而小的必须在他们的边界内，或被压碎出存在。"<!-- p16.s3 -->

## 第十七节：权力本身作为目标

[原文]
> I have quoted at length these passages, which would not surprise one in a description of the German ancestors of National Socialism, because they provide so characteristic an example of that glorification of power which easily leads from socialism to nationalism and which profoundly affects the ethical views of all collectivists.

[译文]
> 我长篇幅地引用了这些段落，如果在国家社会主义的德国祖先的描述中看到这些并不会让人吃惊，因为它们提供了权力光荣化的如此特征的例子，它容易从社会主义导致民族主义，并深刻影响所有集体主义者的伦理观点。<!-- p17.s1 -->

[原文]
> So far as the rights of small nations are concerned, Marx and Engels were little better than most other consistent collectivists, and the views occasionally expressed about Czechs or Poles resemble those of contemporary National Socialists. While to the great individualist social philosophers of the nineteenth century, to a Lord Acton or a Jacob Burckhardt, down to contemporary socialists, like Bertrand Russell, who have inherited the liberal tradition, power itself has always appeared the archevil, to the strict collectivist it is a goal in itself.

[译文]
> 就小国的权利而言，马克思和恩格斯几乎不比大多数其他一致的集体主义者更好，偶尔表达的关于捷克人或波兰人的观点与当代国家社会主义者的观点相似。虽然对于十九世纪伟大的个人主义社会哲学家，对于一个阿克顿勋爵或雅各布·布克哈特，直到当代社会主义者，如伯特兰·罗素，他们继承了自由主义传统，权力本身总是显得是最大的邪恶，对于严格的集体主义者来说这是一个目标本身。<!-- p17.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is not only, as Russell has so well described, that the desire to organize social life according to a unitary plan itself springs largely from a desire for power. It is even more the outcome of the fact that, in order to achieve their end, collectivists must create power—power over men wielded by other men—of a magnitude never before known, and that their success will depend on the extent to which they achieve such power.

[译文]
> 不仅仅是，如罗素所很好地描述的那样，根据单一计划组织社会生活的欲望本身在很大程度上源于对权力的欲望。更重要的是，这是一个事实的结果，即为了实现他们的目标，集体主义者必须创造权力——由其他人行使的对人的权力——的规模是前所未有的，他们的成功将取决于他们实现如此权力的程度。<!-- p17.s3 -->

---

## 第十八节：权力的集中与幻觉

[原文]
> This remains true even though many liberal socialists are guided in their endeavors by the tragic illusion that by depriving private individuals of the power they possess in an individualist system, and by transferring this power to society, they can thereby extinguish power. What all those who argue in this manner overlook is that, by concentrating power so that it can be used in the service of a single plan, it is not merely transferred but infinitely heightened; that, by uniting in the hands of some single body power formerly exercised independently by many, an amount of power is created infinitely greater than any that existed before, so much more far-reaching as almost to be different in kind.

[译文]
> 这仍然是真的，尽管许多自由社会主义者被这样的悲剧幻觉所指导，即通过剥夺个人在个人主义体系中拥有的权力，并将这种权力转移到社会，他们可以因此消灭权力。所有以这种方式论证的人都忽略了，通过集中权力以便它可以用于单一计划的服务，它不仅仅是转移而是无限升高；通过在某个单一身体的手中联合曾经由许多人独立行使的权力，创造了一种无限大于以前存在过的任何数量的权力，如此更广泛几乎要是不同的种类。<!-- p18.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is entirely fallacious when it is sometimes argued that the great power exercised by a central planning board would be "no greater than the power collectively exercised by private boards of directors." There is, in a competitive society, nobody who can exercise even a fraction of the power which a socialist planning board would possess, and if nobody can consciously use the power, it is just an abuse of words to assert that it rests with all the capitalists put together.

[译文]
> 当有时有人论证一个中央计划委员会行使的大权力将"不大于私人董事会集体行使的权力"时，这完全是错误的。在竞争社会中，没有人能行使甚至社会主义计划委员会将拥有的权力的一小部分，而如果没有人能有意识地使用权力，声称它与所有资本家加在一起是滥用语言。<!-- p18.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is merely a play upon words to speak of the "power collectively exercised by private boards of directors" so long as they do not combine to concerted action— which would, of course, mean the end of competition and the creation of a planned economy. To split or decentralize power is necessarily to reduce the absolute amount of power, and the competitive system is the only system designed to minimize by decentralization the power exercised by man over man.

[译文]
> 说"私人董事会集体行使的权力"仅仅是在玩文字游戏，只要他们不结合到协调行动——这当然意味着竞争的结束和计划经济的创建。分割或分散权力必然要减少权力的绝对数量，竞争体系是唯一设计为通过分散化最小化由人对人行使的权力的体系。<!-- p18.s3 -->

---

## 第十九节：经济权力与政治权力的置换

[原文]
> We have seen before how the separation of economic and political aims is an essential guaranty of individual freedom and how it is consequently attacked by all collectivists. To this we must now add that the "substitution of political for economic power" now so often demanded means necessarily the substitution of power from which there is no escape for a power which is always limited.

[译文]
> 我们以前看到过经济和政治目标的分离是个人自由的基本保证，以及它因此如何受到所有集体主义者的攻击。我们现在必须补充，现在经常被要求的"以政治权力取代经济权力"必然意味着以不可逃脱的权力取代总是有限的权力。<!-- p19.s1 -->

[原文]
> What is called economic power, while it can be an instrument of coercion, is, in the hands of private individuals, never exclusive or complete power, never power over the whole life of a person. But centralized as an instrument of political power it creates a degree of dependence scarcely distinguishable from slavery.

[译文]
> 所谓的经济权力，虽然它可以是强制手段，但在私人个人的手中，从不是独占或完全的权力，从不是对一个人整个生活的权力。但作为政治权力的手段集中时，它创造了一种与奴隶制几乎无法区分的依赖程度。<!-- p19.s2 -->

---

## 第二十节：集体主义道德的本质

[原文]
> From the two central features of every collectivist system, the need for a commonly accepted system of ends of the group and the all-overriding desire to give to the group the maximum of power to achieve these ends, grows a definite system of morals, which on some points coincides and on others violently contrasts with ours—but differs from it in one point which makes it doubtful whether we can call it morals: that it does not leave the individual conscience free to apply its own rules and does not even know any general rules which the individual is required or allowed to observe in all circumstances.

[译文]
> 从每个集体主义体系的两个核心特征，对群体目标的普遍接受的体系的需求和对给群体最大权力以实现这些目标的至高压倒的欲望，产生了一个明确的道德体系，它在某些点上与我们的一致，在其他点上剧烈对比——但在一个点上与我们不同，这使人怀疑我们是否可以称之为道德：它不让个人良心自由地应用自己的规则，甚至不知道任何个人在所有情况下都必须或被允许遵守的一般规则。<!-- p20.s1 -->

[原文]
> This makes collectivist morals so different from what we have known as morals that we find it difficult to discover any principle in them, which they nevertheless possess. The difference of principle is very much the same as that which we have already considered in connection with the Rule of Law.

[译文]
> 这使集体主义道德与我们所知的道德如此不同，以至我们发现难以发现其中任何原则，尽管它们确实拥有。原则的差异与我们已经在法治联系中考虑过的非常相同。<!-- p20.s2 -->

---

## 第二十一节：目的论与绝对道德

[原文]
> Like formal law, the rules of individualist ethics, however unprecise they may be in many respects, are general and absolute; they prescribe or prohibit a general type of action irrespective of whether in the particular instance the ultimate purpose is good or bad. To cheat or steal, to torture or betray a confidence, is held to be bad, irrespective of whether or not in the particular instance any harm follows from it.

[译文]
> 像形式法律一样，个人主义伦理的规则，虽然在许多方面可能不精确，但是普遍和绝对的；它们规定或禁止一般类型的行动，无论在特定情况下最终目的是好还是坏。欺骗或偷窃、折磨或背叛信心，被认为是坏的，无论在特定情况下是否有任何伤害从中产生。<!-- p21.s1 -->

[原文]
> Neither the fact that in a given instance nobody may be the worse for it, nor any high purpose for which such an act may have been committed, can alter the fact that it is bad. Though we may sometimes be forced to choose between different evils, they remain evils. The principle that the end justifies the means is in individualist ethics regarded as the denial of all morals.

[译文]
> 既不是在给定的情况下没有人可能因此受害这一事实，也不是任何这样的行为可能为之而提交的高目的，都不能改变它是坏的这一事实。虽然我们有时可能被迫在不同的邪恶之间选择，它们仍然是邪恶。目的为手段辩护的原则在个人主义伦理中被视为所有道德的否定。<!-- p21.s2 -->

[原文]
> In collectivist ethics it becomes necessarily the supreme rule; there is literally nothing which the consistent collectivist must not be prepared to do if it serves "the good of the whole," because the "good of the whole" is to him the only criterion of what ought to be done. The raison d'état, in which collectivist ethics has found its most explicit formulation, knows no other limit than that set by expediency—the suitability of the particular act for the end in view.

[译文]
> 在集体主义伦理中，它必然成为最高规则；字面上没有什么是一致的集体主义者不必准备做的，如果它为"整体的善"服务，因为"整体的善"对他来说是什么应该做的唯一标准。理由政治（Raison d'état），集体主义伦理找到了其最明确的表述，不知道除了权宜之计——特定行为对所述目标的适宜性以外的其他限制。<!-- p21.s3 -->

---

## 第二十二节：极权纪律与道德真空

[原文]
> And what the raison d'état affirms with respect to the relations between different countries applies equally to the relations between different individuals within the collectivist state. There can be no limit to what its citizen must be prepared to do, no act which his conscience must prevent him from committing, if it is necessary for an end which the community has set itself or which his superiors order him to achieve.

[译文]
> 理由政治就不同国家之间的关系所肯定的同样适用于集体主义国家内不同个人之间的关系。对其公民必须准备做什么没有限制，没有他的良心必须阻止他提交的行为，如果这对社区为自己设定的或其上级命令他实现的目的是必要的。<!-- p22.s1 -->

[原文]
> The absence of absolute formal rules in collectivist ethics does not, of course, mean that there are not some useful habits of the individuals which a collectivist community will encourage and others which it will discourage. Quite the reverse; it will take a much greater interest in the individual's habits of life than an individualist community.

[译文]
> 集体主义伦理中缺乏绝对形式规则当然不意味着没有某些有用的个人习惯，集体主义社区将鼓励这些习惯，以及它将劝阻的其他习惯。相反恰恰相反；它将对个人的生活习惯产生比个人主义社区更大的兴趣。<!-- p22.s2 -->

---

## 第二十三节：有用的习惯与道德德行

[原文]
> To be a useful member of a collectivist society requires very definite qualities which must be strengthened by constant practice. The reason why we designate these qualities as "useful habits" and can hardly describe them as moral virtues is that the individual could never be allowed to put these rules above any definite orders or to let them become an obstacle to the achievement of any of the particular aims of his community.

[译文]
> 成为集体主义社会的有用成员需要必须通过不断的实践来加强的非常明确的品质。我们将这些品质指定为"有用的习惯"而几乎不能将其描述为道德美德的原因是，个人永远不被允许将这些规则置于任何明确的命令之上，或让它们成为实现他的社区的任何特定目标的障碍。<!-- p23.s1 -->

[原文]
> They only serve, as it were, to fill any gaps which direct orders or the designation of particular aims may leave, but they can never justify a conflict with the will of the authority. The differences between the virtues which will continue to be esteemed under a collectivist system and those which will disappear is well illustrated by a comparison of the virtues which even their worst enemies admit the Germans, or rather the "typical Prussian," to possess, and those of which they are commonly thought lacking and in which the English people, with some justification, used to pride themselves as excelling.

[译文]
> 它们仅仅是，可以说，填补直接命令或特定目标的指定可能留下的任何空白，但它们永远不能证明与权力的意愿的冲突。将在集体主义体系下继续被重视的德行与将消失的德行之间的差异通过比较甚至他们最坏的敌人承认德国人，或者说"典型的普鲁士人"拥有的德行，以及他们通常被认为缺乏的那些以及英国人过去以某种理由为自己引以为豪表现优越的那些来很好地说明。<!-- p23.s2 -->

---

## 第二十四节：普鲁士美德与西方品格

[原文]
> Few people will deny that the Germans on the whole are industrious and disciplined, thorough and energetic to the degree of ruthlessness, conscientious and single-minded in any tasks they undertake; that they possess a strong sense of order, duty, and strict obedience to authority; and that they often show great readiness to make personal sacrifices and great courage in physical danger.

[译文]
> 很少有人会否认德国人总体上是勤劳和有纪律的，彻底和精力充沛甚至到无情的程度，在他们承担的任何任务中都是认真和专心致志的；他们具有强烈的秩序、责任和对权力严格服从的感觉；他们常常表现出为个人牺牲和在身体危险中伟大勇气的巨大准备。<!-- p24.s1 -->

[原文]
> All these make the German an efficient instrument in carrying out an assigned task, and they have accordingly been carefully nurtured in the old Prussian state and the new Prussian-dominated Reich. What the "typical German" is often thought to lack are the individualist virtues of tolerance and respect for other individuals and their opinions, of independence of mind and that uprightness of character and readiness to defend one's own convictions against a superior which the Germans themselves, usually conscious that they lack it, call Zivilcourage, of consideration for the weak and infirm, and of that healthy contempt and dislike of power which only an old tradition of personal liberty creates.

[译文]
> 所有这些使德国人成为执行指定任务的高效工具，因此它们在旧普鲁士国家和新的普鲁士统治的帝国中被小心地培养。"典型的德国人"经常被认为缺乏的是容忍和尊重其他个人及其观点的个人主义美德、思想的独立性和人格的正直以及准备好针对上级维护自己信念的那种美德（德国人本身通常意识到他们缺乏的叫做民间勇气），对弱者和病弱者的考虑，以及那种健康的对权力的蔑视和厌恶，这只有古老的个人自由传统才能创造。<!-- p24.s2 -->

[原文]
> Deficient they seem also in most of those little yet so important qualities which facilitate the intercourse between men in a free society: kindliness and a sense of humor, personal modesty, and respect for the privacy and belief in the good intentions of one's neighbor.

[译文]
> 他们似乎也在许多那些虽然很小但如此重要的促进自由社会中男人之间交流的品质上不足：亲切和幽默感、个人谦虚以及对隐私的尊重和对邻近意图善良的相信。<!-- p24.s3 -->

---

## 第二十五节：道德与制度的相互作用

[原文]
> After what we have already said it will not cause surprise that these individualist virtues are at the same time eminently social virtues—virtues which smooth social contacts and which make control from above less necessary and at the same time more difficult. They are virtues which flourish wherever the individualist or commercial type of society has prevailed and which are missing according as the collectivist or military type of society predominates—a difference which is, or was, as noticeable between the various regions of Germany as it has now become of the views which rule in Germany and those characteristic of the West.

[译文]
> 在我们已经说过的之后，这些个人主义美德同时是突出的社会美德——光滑社会接触和使从上面的控制更不必要和同时更困难的美德不会引起惊讶。他们是在个人主义或商业类型的社会已经盛行的地方繁荣的美德，以及根据集体主义或军事类型的社会占主导地位而缺失的美德——这种差异如在德国各地之间一样，现在已经成为在德国统治的观点和西方特有的观点之间一样明显。<!-- p25.s1 -->

[原文]
> Until recently, at least, in those parts of Germany which have been longest exposed to the civilizing forces of commerce, the old commercial towns of the south and west and the Hanse towns, the general moral concepts were probably much more akin to those of the Western people than to those which have now become dominant all over Germany.

[译文]
> 直到最近，至少在德国那些最长时间暴露于商业文明力量的部分，南部和西部的古老商业城镇和汉萨城市，一般道德观念可能与西方人民的观念更接近，而不是现在在整个德国变得占主导地位的那些观念。<!-- p25.s2 -->

---

## 第二十六节：极权狂热与无辜的残暴

[原文]
> It would, however, be highly unjust to regard the masses of the totalitarian people as devoid of moral fervor because they give unstinted support to a system which to us seems a denial of most moral values. For the great majority of them the opposite is probably true: the intensity of the moral emotions behind a movement like that of National Socialism or communism can probably be compared only to those of the great religious movements of history.

[译文]
> 然而，由于他们对一个对我们来说似乎是对大多数道德价值的否定的体系给予无限的支持而将极权人民的群众视为缺乏道德热情是高度不公正的。对他们大多数人来说相反的可能是真实的：国家社会主义或共产主义这样的运动背后的道德情感的强度可能只能与历史上伟大的宗教运动的那些相比。<!-- p26.s1 -->

[原文]
> Once you admit that the individual is merely a means to serve the ends of the higher entity called society or the nation, most of those features of totalitarian regimes which horrify us follow of necessity. From the collectivist standpoint intolerance and brutal suppression of dissent, the complete disregard of the life and happiness of the individual, are essential and unavoidable consequences of this basic premise, and the collectivist can admit this and at the same time claim that his system is superior to one in which the "selfish" interests of the individual are allowed to obstruct the full realization of the ends the community pursues.

[译文]
> 一旦你承认个人仅仅是为被称为社会或国家的更高实体的目标服务的手段，我们惊骇的极权政权的那些特征中的大多数必然追随。从集体主义观点看，不容忍和对异议的野蛮压制、对个人生活和幸福的完全无视，是这个基本前提的必不可少和不可避免的后果，而集体主义者可以承认这一点，同时声称他的体系优于允许个人的"自私"利益阻碍社区追求的目标的充分实现的那个。<!-- p26.s2 -->

[原文]
> When German philosophers again and again represent the striving for personal happiness as itself immoral and only the fulfillment of an imposed duty as praiseworthy, they are perfectly sincere, however difficult this may be to understand for those who have been brought up in a different tradition.

[译文]
> 当德国哲学家一再将追求个人幸福本身代表为不道德，而只有履行强加的责任被代表为值得赞美时，他们是完全真诚的，尽管这对于在不同传统中成长的人可能很难理解。<!-- p26.s3 -->

---

## 第二十七节：必要的邪恶与权力的筛选

[原文]
> Where there is one common all-overriding end, there is no room for any general morals or rules. To a limited extent we ourselves experience this in wartime. But even war and the greatest peril had led in the democratic countries only to a very moderate approach to totalitarianism, very little setting-aside of all other values in the service of a single purpose.

[译文]
> 凡是有一个共同的至高压倒的目标，就没有任何一般道德或规则的余地。在有限的程度上，我们自己在战时经历过这一点。但即使战争和最大的危险在民主国家中也只导致了对极权主义的非常温和的接近，对单一目标的服务中的所有其他价值设置很少。<!-- p27.s1 -->

[原文]
> But where a few specific ends dominate the whole of society, it is inevitable that occasionally cruelty may become a duty; that acts which revolt all our feeling, such as the shooting of hostages or the killing of the old or sick, should be treated as mere matters of expediency; that the compulsory uprooting and transportation of hundreds of thousand should become an instrument of policy approved by almost everybody except the victims; or that suggestions like that of a "conscription of woman for breeding purposes" can be seriously contemplated.

[译文]
> 但在少数几个特定目标主导整个社会的地方，不可避免地偶尔残忍可能变成一个责任；违反我们所有感受的行为，如射击人质或杀死老人或病人，应该被视为单纯的权宜之计；强制拔根和运送数十万应该成为由几乎所有人除了受害者之外批准的政策工具；或对"为了繁殖目的征兵女性"这样的建议可以被认真考虑。<!-- p27.s2 -->

[原文]
> There is always in the eyes of the collectivist a greater goal which these acts serve and which to him justifies them because the pursuit of the common end of society can know no limits in any rights or values of any individual.

[译文]
> 在集体主义者的眼中总是有一个更大的目标，这些行为为其服务，对他来说这为它们辩护，因为对社会共同目标的追求在任何个人的任何权利或价值中都不能知道任何限制。<!-- p27.s3 -->

---

## 第二十八节：领导者的选拔与道德的腐蚀

[原文]
> But while for the mass of the citizens of the totalitarian state it is often unselfish devotion to an ideal, although one that is repellent to us, which makes them approve and even perform such deeds, this cannot be pleaded for those who guide its policy. To be a useful assistant in the running of a totalitarian state, it is not enough that a man should be prepared to accept specious justification of vile deeds; he must himself be prepared actively to break every moral rule he has ever known if this seems necessary to achieve the end set for him.

[译文]
> 但虽然对于极权国家的大多数公民，经常是对一个理想的无私奉献，虽然一个对我们来说令人厌恶的理想，使他们赞成甚至执行这样的行为，这不能为指导其政策的人辩护。要在极权国家的运作中成为有用的助手，一个人准备接受对邪恶行为的虚假理由是不够的；他自己必须准备积极地打破他曾经知道的每一条道德规则，如果这似乎对实现为他设定的目标是必要的。<!-- p28.s1 -->

[原文]
> Since it is the supreme leader who alone determines the ends, his instruments must have no moral convictions of their own. They must, above all, be unreservedly committed to the person of the leader; but next to this the most important thing is that they should be completely unprincipled and literally capable of everything. They must have no ideals of their own which they want to realize; no ideas about right or wrong which might interfere with the intentions of the leader.

[译文]
> 既然正是最高领导者单独决定目标，他的工具不必有自己的道德信念。首先，他们必须对领导者的人无保留地承诺；但除了这一点，最重要的是他们应该完全无原则和字面上能够做任何事。他们不必有他们想要实现的自己的理想；没有关于对错的想法可能会干扰领导者的意图。<!-- p28.s2 -->

[原文]
> There is thus in the positions of power little to attract those who hold moral beliefs of the kind which in the past have guided the European peoples, little which could compensate for the distastefulness of many of the particular tasks, and little opportunity to gratify any more idealistic desires, to recompense for the undeniable risk, the sacrifice of most of the pleasures of private life and of personal independence which the posts of great responsibility involve.

[译文]
> 因此，在权力职位中，很少有东西吸引那些持有曾经引导欧洲人民的那种道德信念的人，很少有东西可以补偿许多特定任务的不愉快，很少有机会满足任何更理想的欲望，补偿无可否认的风险，牺牲大多数私人生活的乐趣和承诺大责任职位所涉及的个人独立。<!-- p28.s3 -->

---

## 第二十九节：权力的吸引力与选拔的机制

[原文]
> The only tastes which are satisfied are the taste for power as such and the pleasure of being obeyed and of being part of a well-functioning and immensely powerful machine to which everything else must give way. Yet while there is little that is likely to induce men who are good by our standards to aspire to leading positions in the totalitarian machine, and much to deter them, there will be special opportunities for the ruthless and unscrupulous.

[译文]
> 被满足的唯一品味是对权力本身的品味和被服从的快乐以及成为一个运转良好且非常强大的机器一部分的快乐，一切其他的东西都必须让步。然而，虽然几乎没有可能诱使按我们标准是好的男人去渴望极权机器中的领导职位，以及很多足以阻止他们的东西，无原则和无情者将有特殊的机会。<!-- p29.s1 -->

[原文]
> There will be jobs to be done about the badness of which taken by themselves nobody has any doubt, but which have to be done in the service of some higher end, and which have to be executed with the same expertness and efficiency as any others. And as there will be need for actions which are bad in themselves, and which all those still influenced by traditional morals will be reluctant to perform, the readiness to do bad things becomes a path to promotion and power.

[译文]
> 将有一些工作要做，就其本身的坏而言，没有人有任何疑问，但它们必须在某个更高目标的服务中完成，并且必须以与任何其他目标相同的专业知识和效率执行。而由于需要在本身是坏的、所有仍然受传统道德影响的人不愿进行的行为，准备做坏事变成了晋升和权力的道路。<!-- p29.s2 -->

[原文]
> The positions in a totalitarian society in which it is necessary to practice cruelty and intimidation, deliberate deception and spying, are numerous. Neither the Gestapo nor the administration of a concentration camp, neither the Ministry of Propaganda nor the SA or SS (or their Italian or Russian counterparts), are suitable places for the exercise of humanitarian feelings. Yet it is through positions like these that the road to the highest positions in the totalitarian state leads.

[译文]
> 在极权社会中，需要实践残忍和威胁、蓄意欺骗和间谍活动的职位众多。既不是盖世太保也不是集中营的管理，既不是宣传部也不是冲锋队或党卫队（或他们的意大利或俄罗斯对应物），都不是适合行使人道主义感受的地方。然而，正是通过这样的职位，通向极权国家最高职位的道路才能实现。<!-- p29.s3 -->

---

## 第三十节：歇伦科的比喻与必然的推论

[原文]
> It is only too true when a distinguished American economist concludes from a similar brief enumeration of the duties of the authorities of a collectivist state that "they would have to do these things whether they wanted to or not: and the probability of the people in power being individuals who would dislike the possession and exercise of power is on a level with the probability that an extremely tender-hearted person would get the job of whipping-master in a slave plantation."

[译文]
> 当一位杰出的美国经济学家从集体主义国家权力的责任的类似简短列举中得出结论说"他们无论是否愿意都必须做这些事：而掌权的人是那些不满权力的拥有和行使的个人的概率与一个极其温柔心肠的人获得奴隶种植园中鞭挞大师工作的概率相同"时，这只是太真实了。<!-- p30.s1 -->

[原文]
> We cannot, however, exhaust this subject here. The problem of the selection of the leaders is closely bound up with the wide problem of selection according to the opinions held, or rather according to the readiness with which a person conforms to an ever changing set of doctrines. And this leads us to one of the most characteristic moral features of totalitarianism: its relation to, and its effect on, all the virtues falling under the general heading of truthfulness. This is so big a subject that it requires a separate chapter.

[译文]
> 然而，我们不能在这里用尽这个主题。领导者选拔的问题与根据观点所持有的广泛选拔问题密切相关，或者说根据一个人与不断变化的教义集的一致性的准备程度。这导致我们走向极权主义最具特征的道德特征之一：其与、以及其对落在真实性一般标题下的所有美德的影响。这是如此大的一个主题，它需要单独的一章。<!-- p30.s2 -->

## 本章修订记录

- v0.1-初译：完成第10章初稿翻译，建立基本框架和段落结构，共30个细粒度段落。论述了极权主义权力结构的必然性、无原则者的优势、集体主义道德的特异性等核心议题。

## 注释

### 原注

[注-原-1] Lord Acton, Historical Essays and Studies, ed. John Neville Figgis and Reginald Vere Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1919), p. 504.

[注-原-2] Hayek's list comprises a rogue's gallery of infamous National Socialist "blackguards and thugs." Journalist and politician Julius Streicher (1885–1946), an early associate of Hitler's, is remembered for the vehemence of his persecution of the Jews in his newspaper Der Stürmer. He was convicted of war crimes at Nuremburg and hanged. Manfred von Killinger (1886–1944) made his name in the early 1920s for his role in the assassination of Matthias Erzberger, the politician who signed the armistice. A member of the SA (Sturmabteilung), the brown-shirted storm troopers that served as the early army of the Nazi party, he later entered the diplomatic service. Killinger committed suicide in Bucharest as the Soviet army was entering the city. Robert Ley (1890–1945) was the guiding force behind the forced reorganization of the trade unions into a single labor front, as well as the Kraft durch Freude recreational movement within it. He hanged himself in Nuremberg before the proceedings there began. Edmund Heines (1897–1934) was a general in the SA and intimate associate of its leader, Ernst Röhm. He was executed in June 1934 during the "Night of the Long Knives" in which Hitler purged elements of the SA. Following the purge, the black-shirted SS (Schutztaffel ), which began as Hitler's personal bodyguard, was elevated above the SA, and Heinrich Himmler (1900–1945) was put in charge of both the SS and the Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei), or secret state police. Himmler expanded and transformed the SS into an elite guard that had among its tasks the administration of the concentration and extermination camps. Chief architect of the holocaust, Himmler escaped the executioner by swallowing a cyanide tablet after his capture by the British. Reinhard Heydrich (1904–1942), known as "the hangman," was second in command to Himmler in the Gestapo. He was assassinated by the Czech resistance in 1942; the village of Lidice was razed and all its men executed in reprisal.

[注-原-4] It is entirely in the spirit of collectivism when Nietzsche makes his Zarathustra say: "A thousand goals have existed hitherto, for a thousand people existed. But the fetter for the thousand necks is still lacking, the one goal is still lacking. Humanity has no goal yet. But tell me, I pray, my brethren: if the goal be lacking to humanity, is not humanity itself lacking?" [Hayek quotes from Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra; the passage appears at the end of chapter 15. —Ed.]

[注-原-5] Quoted from an article of Dr. Niebuhr's by E. H. Carr, The Twenty Years' Crisis, 1919–1939: An Introduction to the Study of International Relations (London: Macmillan, 1940), p. 203. [The article that Carr quotes from was Reinhold Niebuhr, "A Critique of Fascism," Atlantic Monthly, vol. 139, May 1927, p. 639. The American protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr (1892–1971) was an advocate of Christian realism. In his Moral Man and Immoral Society, op cit., Niebuhr examined the implications of the idea that social groups often engage in practices that would be considered repugnant on the individual level. —Ed.]

[Halévy's first book was translated as The Era of Tyrannies: Essays on Socialism and War, op. cit., and the discussion of the Webbs and Shaw may be found on page 271 of the translation. Irish playwright and essayist George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) was an early member of the Fabian Society. His most famous work was Pygmalion, but he was also known in the interwar period for such tracts as The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism (London: Constable, 1928).

[注-原-8] Cf. Karl Marx, Revolution and Counter-revolution, and Engels's letter to Marx, May 23, 1851. [Revolution and Counter-revolution is a history of the revolution of 1848, written by Friedrich Engels and originally published as articles in the New York Tribune between October 1851 and September 1852. It is reprinted in Friedrich Engels, The German Revolutions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967), and the discussion of the Poles and the "Tschechs" may be found on pp. 174–81. Though written by Engels, the articles were sent to the newspaper through Marx and published under Marx's name, which is why Hayek refers to Marx, rather than Engels, as the author. Here is part of what Engels wrote to Marx in his letter of May 23, 1851: "The more I think about it, the more obvious it becomes to me that the Poles are une nation foutue [a finished nation] who can only continue to serve a purpose until such time as Russia herself becomes caught up into the agrarian revolution. From that moment Poland will have absolutely no raison d'être any more. The Poles' sole contribution to history has been to indulge in foolish pranks at once valiant and provocative. Nor can a single moment be cited when Poland, even if only by comparison with Russia, has successfully represented progress or done anything of historical significance."

[注-原-9] [Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) wrote principally about the Italian renaissance and Greek civilization, hoping that knowledge of the foundations of European culture would serve as a bulwark against the social, political, and cultural upheavals that he witnessed in the nineteenth century. In his book Force and Freedom: Reflections on History, trans. James Hastings Nichols (New York: Pantheon, 1943), based on lectures he had delivered just prior to the formation of the German Empire, he presciently warned about coming periods of great national wars and of the dangers of all-powerful states. British philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), who made important contributions to the foundations of mathematics, logic, and analytic philosophy, was also a public figure famous for his antiwar activities, his frequent marriages and even more numerous affairs, and, later in life, his support of nuclear disarmament. —Ed.]

[注-原-12] We must not allow ourselves to be deceived by the fact that the word "power," apart from the sense in which it is used with respect to human beings, is also used in an impersonal (or rather anthropomorphic) sense for any determining cause. Of course, there will always be something that determines everything that happens, and in this sense the amount of power existing must always be the same. But this is not true of the power consciously wielded by human beings.

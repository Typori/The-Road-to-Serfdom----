# Security and Freedom
# 安全与自由

> 摘要：本章深入分析经济安全与自由的根本冲突。哈耶克区分两种安全：防止严重贫困的有限安全（可以为全社会提供）与保证特定生活水准的绝对安全（必然是特权）。追求绝对安全的政策导致一些群体获得保护，其代价是其他群体不安全增加，最终迫使人们在自由与安全间做出绝望的选择。本章警告，过度追求安全会导致社会逐步演变为类似德国的"官僚国家"，最终使自由本身变成奢侈品。

## 第一节：安全与自由的二律背反

[原文]
> The whole of society will have become a single office and a single factory with equality of work and equality of pay. —Nikolai Lenin (1917)

[译文]
> 整个社会将变成单一的办公室和单一的工厂，工作平等和报酬平等。——尼古拉·列宁（1917年）<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> In a country where the sole employer is the State, opposition means death by slow starvation. The old principle: who does not work shall not eat, has been replaced by a new one: who does not obey shall not eat.

[译文]
> 在唯一雇主是国家的国家，反对意味着缓慢饿死。旧原则"不劳动者不得食"已被新原则所取代："不服从者不得食"。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> Like the spurious "economic freedom," and with more justice, economic security is often represented as an indispensable condition of real liberty. In a sense this is both true and important. Independence of mind or strength of character is rarely found among those who cannot be confident that they will make their way by their own effort.

[译文]
> 与虚伪的"经济自由"一样，经济安全常常被代表为真实自由不可或缺的条件，这在某种意义上既是真实的也是重要的。那些无法确信自己能通过自己的努力成功的人，很少具有思想上的独立性或性格的坚强。<!-- p1.s3 -->

[原文]
> Yet the idea of economic security is no less vague and ambiguous than most other terms in this field; and because of this the general approval given to the demand for security may become a danger to liberty. Indeed, when security is understood in too absolute a sense, the general striving for it, far from increasing the chances of freedom, becomes the gravest threat to it.

[译文]
> 然而，经济安全的理念与这个领域中大多数其他术语一样模糊且含混；正因为如此，对安全需求的普遍赞成可能会成为对自由的危险。实际上，当安全被理解为过于绝对的意义时，对它的普遍追求非但不会增加自由的机会，反而会成为对自由最严重的威胁。<!-- p1.s4 -->

---

## 第二节：两种安全的区分

[原文]
> It will be well to contrast at the outset the two kinds of security: the limited one, which can be achieved for all, and which is therefore no privilege but a legitimate object of desire; and absolute security, which in a free society cannot be achieved for all and which ought not to be given as a privilege—except in a few special instances such as that of the judges, where complete independence is of paramount importance.

[译文]
> 从一开始就区分两种安全是有益的：有限安全，它可以为全部人实现，因此不是特权而是合法的欲望对象；与绝对安全形成对比，后者在自由社会中无法为全部人实现，也不应作为特权给予——除了少数特殊情况，比如法官的情况，其中完全的独立是至关重要的。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> These two kinds of security are, first, security against severe physical privation, the certainty of a given minimum of sustenance for all; and, second, the security of a given standard of life, or of the relative position which one person or group enjoys compared with others; or, as we may put it briefly, the security of a minimum income and the security of the particular income a person is thought to deserve.

[译文]
> 这两种安全是：第一，防止严重物质匮乏的安全，即为全部人提供一定最低生活保障的确定性；第二，特定生活水准的安全，或某人或某群体相对于他人所享有的相对地位的安全；或简而言之，最低收入的安全与某人被认为应该得到的特定收入的安全。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> We shall presently see that this distinction largely coincides with the distinction between the security which can be provided for all outside of and supplementary to the market system and the security which can be provided only for some and only by controlling or abolishing the market.

[译文]
> 我们将很快看到，这种区分在很大程度上与这样的区分相一致：可以为全部人在市场体系之外并作为其补充而提供的安全，与只能为某些人提供的、且只能通过控制或废除市场来提供的安全。<!-- p2.s3 -->

---

## 第三节：有限安全的可行性

[原文]
> There is no reason why in a society which has reached the general level of wealth which ours has attained the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom. There are difficult questions about the precise standard which should thus be assured; there is particularly the important question whether those who thus rely on the community should indefinitely enjoy all the same liberties as the rest.

[译文]
> 在我们所达到的这样普遍财富水平的社会中，没有理由第一种安全不能被保障给全部人而不危害整体自由。关于应该确保的精确标准，存在着困难的问题；特别是存在一个重要的问题，即那些因此依赖社区的人是否应该无限期地享受与其他人相同的所有自由。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> An incautious handling of these questions might well cause serious and perhaps even dangerous political problems; but there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody. Indeed, for a considerable part of the population of England this sort of security has long been achieved.

[译文]
> 不谨慎地处理这些问题确实可能引发严重的甚至危险的政治问题；但毫无疑问，某种食物、住所和衣着的最低标准——足以保护健康和工作能力——可以向所有人保证。实际上，对于英国相当大一部分人口来说，这种安全早已实现。<!-- p3.s2 -->

---

## 第四节：社会保险与共同风险

[原文]
> Nor is there any reason why the state should not assist the individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. Where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance— where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks—the case for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.

[译文]
> 同样，没有理由国家不应该在帮助个人应对那些生活中的常见风险时提供协助——这些风险因其不确定性使得很少有个人能做出充分准备。在疾病和事故的情况下，既然提供援助通常既不会削弱避免这类灾难的愿望，也不会削弱克服其后果的努力——简言之，在我们处理真正可保险的风险的地方——国家帮助组织全面的社会保险体系的理由是非常充分的。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> There are many points of detail where those wishing to preserve the competitive system and those wishing to supercede it by something different will disagree on the details of such schemes; and it is possible under the name of social insurance to introduce measures which tend to make competition more or less ineffective. But there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom.

[译文]
> 在许多细节上，希望保留竞争体系的人与希望用别的东西取代它的人对这样的方案的细节会有分歧；而且可以以社会保险的名义引入倾向于使竞争或多或少无效的措施。但国家以这种方式提供更大安全与维护个人自由之间原则上没有不兼容之处。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> To the same category belongs also the increase of security through the state's rendering assistance to the victims of such "acts of God" as earthquakes and floods. Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.

[译文]
> 国家通过为地震和洪水等"天灾"的受害者提供援助而增加安全，也属于同一类别。只要集体行动能够缓解那些个人既无法自卫也无法为其后果做准备的灾难，这样的集体行动无疑应该采取。<!-- p4.s3 -->

---

## 第五节：经济波动与良性计划

[原文]
> There is, finally, the supremely important problem of combating general fluctuations of economic activity and the recurrent waves of large-scale unemployment which accompany them. This is, of course, one of the gravest and most pressing problems of our time. But, though its solution will require much planning in the good sense, it does not—or at least need not—require that special kind of planning which according to its advocates is to replace the market.

[译文]
> 最后，还有一个至高重要的问题：对抗经济活动的普遍波动以及随之而来的周期性大规模失业浪潮。这当然是我们时代最严重和最紧迫的问题之一。但虽然其解决需要大量良性的计划，但它不必——至少不一定需要——那种按其倡导者的说法应该取代市场的特殊计划。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> Many economists hope, indeed, that the ultimate remedy may be found in the field of monetary policy, which would involve nothing incompatible even with nineteenth-century liberalism. Others, it is true, believe that real success can be expected only from the skillful timing of public works undertaken on a very large scale. This might lead to much more serious restrictions of the competitive sphere, and, in experimenting in this direction, we shall have carefully to watch our step if we are to avoid making all economic activity progressively more dependent on the direction and volume of government expenditure.

[译文]
> 许多经济学家确实希望最终的补救可能在货币政策领域找到，这甚至与十九世纪的自由主义没有任何不兼容之处。诚然，其他人相信真正的成功只能从精妙地安排大规模公共工程的时机中期望。这可能导致对竞争领域更严重的限制，在这个方向上进行实验时，如果我们要避免使所有经济活动逐步变得更依赖于政府支出的方向和规模，我们必须谨慎地观察自己的步伐。<!-- p5.s2 -->

[原文]
> But this is neither the only nor, in my opinion, the most promising way of meeting the gravest threat to economic security. In any case, the very necessary efforts to secure protection against these fluctuations do not lead to the kind of planning which constitutes such a threat to our freedom.

[译文]
> 但这既不是唯一的，也不是我认为最有前景的方式来应对对经济安全的最严重威胁。无论如何，为了防止这些波动而进行的非常必要的努力不会导致那种对我们自由构成威胁的计划。<!-- p5.s3 -->

---

## 第六节：求偿安全与权力控制的必然性

[原文]
> The planning for security which has such an insidious effect on liberty is that for security of a different kind. It is planning designed to protect individuals or groups against diminutions of their income, which although in no way deserved yet in a competitive society occur daily, against losses imposing severe hardships having no moral justification yet inseparable from the competitive system.

[译文]
> 对自由有如此阴险影响的安全计划是另一种安全的计划。它是为保护个人或群体免受收入减少而设计的，这些减少虽然在竞争社会中每天都在发生却毫无其可以被证成，也是保护他们免受虽然没有道德根据却与竞争体系分不开的严重损失。<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> This demand for security is thus another form of the demand for a just remuneration— a remuneration commensurate with the subjective merits and not with the objective results of a man's efforts. This kind of security or justice seems irreconcilable with freedom to choose one's employment.

[译文]
> 这种对安全的要求因此是对正当报酬的要求的另一种形式——与主观功绩相称而非与人的努力的客观结果相称的报酬。这种安全或正义似乎与自由选择职业的自由不可调和。<!-- p6.s2 -->

---

## 第七节：报酬与有用性的背离

[原文]
> In any system which for the distribution of men between the different trades and occupations relies on their own choice it is necessary that the remuneration in these trades should correspond to their usefulness to the other members of society, even if this should stand in no relation to subjective merit. Although the results achieved will often be commensurate with efforts and intentions, this cannot always be true in any form of society.

[译文]
> 在任何依靠个人选择来分配人员在不同行业和职业之间的体系中，这些行业中的报酬必须与它们对社会其他成员的有用性相符，即使这与主观功绩毫无关系。虽然所取得的结果通常将与努力和意图相称，但这在任何形式的社会中都不总是真的。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> It will particularly not be true in the many instances where the usefulness of some trade or special skill is changed by circumstances which could not be foreseen. We all know the tragic plight of the highly trained man whose hard-learned skill has suddenly lost its value because of some invention which greatly benefits the rest of society. The history of the last hundred years is full of instances of this kind, some of them affecting hundreds of thousands of people at a time.

[译文]
> 特别在许多情况下这是不真的，即某种行业或特殊技能的有用性由无法预见的情况所改变。我们都知道这样一个悲剧：高度训练有素的人因为某项大大造福社会其他部分的发明而使其辛苦学来的技能突然失去价值。过去一百年的历史充满了这样的例子，其中一些一次影响数十万人。<!-- p7.s2 -->

[原文]
> That anyone should suffer a great diminution of his income and bitter disappointment of all his hopes through no fault of his own, and despite hard work and exceptional skill, undoubtedly offends our sense of justice. The demands of those who suffer in this way, for state interference on their behalf to safeguard their legitimate expectations, are certain to receive popular sympathy and support.

[译文]
> 任何人因自己的过错而不是通过自己的坚苦和卓越技能而遭受大幅收入减少和希望破灭，无疑会冒犯我们的正义感。那些这样受苦的人对国家代表他们进行干预以维护其合理期望的要求，必然会获得普遍的同情和支持。<!-- p7.s3 -->

[原文]
> The general approval of these demands has had the effect that governments everywhere have taken action, not merely to protect the people so threatened from severe hardship and privation, but to secure to them the continued receipt of their former income and to shelter them from the vicissitudes of the market.

[译文]
> 对这些要求的普遍赞成产生了这样的效果：世界各地的政府不仅采取行动保护受威胁的人们免受严重困难和贫困，而且确保他们继续获得之前的收入并使他们免受市场的不测。<!-- p7.s4 -->

---

## 第八节：绝对安全的悖论与权力分配化

[原文]
> Certainty of a given income can, however, not be given to all if any freedom in the choice of one's occupation is to be allowed. And, if it is provided for some, it becomes a privilege at the expense of others whose security is thereby necessarily diminished.

[译文]
> 然而，如果要允许职业选择的任何自由，给定收入的确定性不能给予所有人。而如果它为某些人提供，它就成为以其他人安全必然减少为代价的特权。<!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> That security of an invariable income can be provided for all only by the abolition of all freedom in the choice of one's employment is easily shown. Yet, although such a general guaranty of legitimate expectation is often regarded as the ideal to be aimed at, it is not a thing which is seriously attempted. What is constantly being done is to grant this kind of security piecemeal, to this group and to that, with the result that for those who are left out in the cold the insecurity constantly increases.

[译文]
> 很容易显示，不变收入的安全只能通过废除职业选择的所有自由来为全部人提供。然而，虽然这样对合理期望的普遍担保常常被看作要追求的理想，但这并不是真正被尝试过的事情。所做的是不断地分段地向这个群体和那个群体授予这种安全，结果是被冷落在一边的人的不安全不断增加。<!-- p8.s2 -->

[原文]
> No wonder that in consequence the value attached to the privilege of security constantly increases, the demand for it becomes more and more urgent, until in the end no price, not even that of liberty, appears too high.

[译文]
> 难怪由此而来安全特权所附加的价值不断增加，对它的要求变得越来越迫切，直到最后，甚至自由的价格似乎也不算太高。<!-- p8.s3 -->

---

## 第九节：报酬削弱激励与权力与依赖的必然

[原文]
> If those whose usefulness is reduced by circumstances which they could neither foresee nor control were to be protected against undeserved loss, and those whose usefulness has been increased in the same way were prevented from making an unmerited gain, remuneration would soon cease to have any relation to actual usefulness. It would depend on the views held by some authority about what a person ought to have done, what he ought to have foreseen, and how good or bad his intentions were. Such decisions could not but be to a large extent arbitrary.

[译文]
> 若那些有用性因他们既无法预见也无法控制的情况而减少的人被保护免受不应得的损失，而那些有用性以同样方式增加的人被阻止做出不应得的收益，报酬将很快与实际有用性失去任何关系。它将取决于某个权力机构对一个人应该做什么、应该预见什么以及其意图有多好或多坏的观点。这样的决定必然在很大程度上是武断的。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> The application of this principle would necessarily bring it about that people doing the same work would receive different remuneration. The differences in remuneration would then no longer present an adequate inducement to people to make the changes which are socially desirable, and it would not even be possible for the individuals affected to judge whether a particular change is worth the trouble it causes.

[译文]
> 这一原则的应用必然会导致做同样工作的人获得不同的报酬。报酬的差异就将不再对人们做出社会期望的改变提供充分的激励，受影响的个人甚至不可能判断某个特定改变是否值得其造成的麻烦。<!-- p9.s2 -->

[原文]
> But if the changes in the distribution of men between different employments, which are constantly necessary in any society, can no longer be brought about by pecuniary "rewards" and "penalties" (which have no necessary connection with subjective merit), they must be brought about by direct orders. When a person's income is guaranteed, he can neither be allowed to stay in his job merely because he likes it nor to choose what other work he would like to do. As it is not he who makes the gain or suffers the loss dependent on his moving or not moving, the choice must be made for him by those who control the distribution of the available income.

[译文]
> 但如果在任何社会中不断必需的人员在不同职业间的分配的改变不能再由金钱的"奖励"和"惩罚"（与主观功绩没有必然联系）来实现，它们就必须由直接命令来实现。当一个人的收入被担保时，他既不能被允许仅因为喜欢就留在其工作中，也不能选择他想从事什么其他工作。既然不是他自己做出移动或不移动时的收益或损失，选择就必须由控制可用收入分配的人为他做出。<!-- p9.s3 -->

---

## 第十节：激励问题与社会有用性的标尺

[原文]
> The problem of adequate incentives which arises here is commonly discussed as if it were a problem mainly of the willingness of people to do their best. But this, although important, is not the whole, nor even the most important, aspect of the problem. It is not merely that if we want people to give their best we must make it worth while for them.

[译文]
> 这里产生的充分激励问题通常被讨论得好像它主要是人们愿意尽力的问题。但这虽然重要，却不是问题的全部，甚至不是最重要的方面。并不仅仅是说，若我们想要人们尽力，我们就必须让它对他们有利。<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> What is more important is that if we want to leave them the choice, if they are to be able to judge what they ought to do, they must be given some readily intelligible yardstick by which to measure the social importance of the different occupations. Even with the best will in the world it would be impossible for anyone intelligently to choose between various alternatives if the advantages they offered him stood in no relation to their usefulness to society.

[译文]
> 更重要的是，如果我们想留给他们选择，如果他们要能够判断他们应该做什么，他们必须被给予某种容易理解的标尺来衡量不同职业的社会重要性。即使抱有世界上最好的意愿，若一个人被提供的优势与其对社会的有用性毫无关系，任何人也不可能聪慧地在各种选择之间进行选择。<!-- p10.s2 -->

[原文]
> To know whether as the result of a change a man ought to leave a trade and an environment which he has come to like, and exchange it for another, it is necessary that the changed relative value of these occupations to society should find expression in the remunerations they offer.

[译文]
> 为了知道一个人是否应该因为某个改变而离开他已经适应喜欢的行业和环境，并为另一个交换，有必要这些职业对社会的改变的相对价值应该在它们提供的报酬中得到表达。<!-- p10.s3 -->

---

## 第十一节：纪律问题与极权主义的必然

[原文]
> The problem is, of course, even more important because in the world as it is men are, in fact, not likely to give their best for long periods unless their own interests are directly involved. At least for great numbers some external pressure is needed if they are to give their best. The problem of incentives in this sense is a very real one, both in the sphere of ordinary labor and in those of the managerial activities.

[译文]
> 问题当然更加重要，因为在我们所处的世界中，事实上，除非人的自身利益直接涉及，否则他们不太可能在长期内尽力。至少对很大一部分人来说，若他们要尽力，某种外部压力是需要的。在这个意义上的激励问题在普通劳动领域和管理活动领域都是很实际的问题。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> The application of the engineering technique to a whole nation— and this is what planning means—"raises problems of discipline which are hard to solve," as has been well described by an American engineer with great experience in government planning, who has clearly seen the problem.

[译文]
> 工程技术对整个民族的应用——这就是计划的意思——"引发了难以解决的纪律问题"，这是一位在政府计划中有丰富经验的美国工程师很好地描述过的，他清楚地看到了这个问题。<!-- p11.s2 -->

[原文]
> "In order to do an engineering job," he explains, "there ought to be surrounding the work a comparatively large area of unplanned economic action. There should be a place from which workers can be drawn, and when a worker is fired he should vanish from the job and from the pay-roll. In the absence of such a free reservoir discipline cannot be maintained without corporal punishment, as with slave labor."

[译文]
> 他解释说："为了做好一个工程项目，工作的周围应该有相对较大的、无计划的经济活动区域。应该有一个可以抽取工人的地方，而且当一个工人被解雇时，他应该从工作和薪资单上消失。在没有这样一个自由储备库的情况下，纪律不能在没有体罚的情况下被维持，如同奴隶劳动一样。"<!-- p11.s3 -->

[原文]
> In the sphere of executive work the problem of sanctions for negligence arises in a different but no less serious form. It has been well said that, while the last resort of a competitive economy is the bailiff, the ultimate sanction of a planned economy is the hangman. The powers the manager of any plant will have to be given will still be considerable.

[译文]
> 在行政管理工作的领域，疏忽的制裁问题以不同但同样严肃的形式出现。有句言之有理的话说，虽然竞争经济的最后手段是执行官，但计划经济的最终制裁是绞刑吏。任何工厂经理必须被赋予的权力仍然会相当大。<!-- p11.s4 -->

[原文]
> But no more than in the case of the worker can the manager's position and income in a planned system be made to depend merely on the success or failure of the work under his direction. As neither the risk nor the gain is his, it cannot be his personal judgment, but whether he does what he ought to have done according to some established rule, which must decide.

[译文]
> 但和工人的情况一样，计划体系中经理的地位和收入也不能仅取决于其指导下工作的成功或失败。既然风险和收益都不是他的，就不能是他的个人判断，而必须是他是否按照某项既定规则做了他应该做的事来决定。<!-- p11.s5 -->

[原文]
> A mistake he "ought" to have avoided is not his own affair; it is a crime against the community and must be treated as such. While so long as he keeps to the safe path of objectively ascertainable duty he may be surer of his income than the capitalist entrepreneur, the danger which threatens him in case of real failure is worse than bankruptcy. He may be economically secure so long as he satisfies his superiors, but this security is bought at the price of the safety of freedom and life.

[译文]
> 他"应该"避免的错误不是他自己的事；这是对社区的犯罪，必须被这样对待。虽然只要他坚守在客观可确定的责任的安全路径上，他的收入比资本家企业家可能更有把握，但如果真正失败了，他面临的危险比破产还糟。只要他满足其上级，他可能在经济上是安全的，但这种安全是用自由和生命的安全的代价换来的。<!-- p11.s6 -->

---

## 第十二节：商业社会与军事社会的对立

[原文]
> The conflict with which we have to deal is, indeed, a quite fundamental one between two irreconcilable types of social organization, which, from the most characteristic forms in which they appear, have often been described as the commercial and the military type of society. The terms were, perhaps, unfortunate, because they direct attention to unessentials and make it difficult to see that we face a real alternative and that there is no third possibility.

[译文]
> 我们要处理的冲突确实是在两种不可调和的社会组织类型之间的根本性冲突，从它们最具特征的形式来看，常常被称为社会的商业类型和军事类型。这些术语也许不太恰当，因为它们把注意力吸引到非本质的东西上，使得很难看到我们面对的是一个真实的替代方案，而且没有第三种可能性。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> Either both the choice and the risk rest with the individual or he is relieved of both. The army does, indeed, in many ways represent the closest approach familiar to us to the second type of organization, where work and worker alike are allotted by authority and where, if the available means are scanty, everybody is alike put on short-commons.

[译文]
> 要么选择和风险都由个人承担，要么他都被解除。军队确实在许多方面代表了我们所熟悉的最接近第二种组织类型的形式，在这种类型中，工作和工人都由权力机构分配，而如果可用的手段稀缺，每个人也同样地被限制供给。<!-- p12.s2 -->

[原文]
> This is the only system in which the individual can be conceded full economic security and through the extension of which to the whole of society it can be achieved for all its members. This security is, however, inseparable from the restrictions on liberty and the hierarchical order of military life—it is the security of the barracks.

[译文]
> 这是唯一一个体系，在其中个人可以被承认具有充分的经济安全，而通过将其扩展到整个社会，这可以为其所有成员实现。然而，这种安全与对自由的限制和军事生活的等级制秩序不可分割——这是营房的安全。<!-- p12.s3 -->

---

## 第十三节：自愿性与强制性的矛盾

[原文]
> It is possible, of course, to organize sections of an otherwise free society on this principle, and there is no reason why this form of life, with its necessary restrictions on individual liberty, should not be open to those who prefer it. Indeed, some voluntary labor service on military lines might well be the best form for the state to provide the certainty of an opportunity for work and a minimum income for all.

[译文]
> 当然可以按照这一原则组织一个在其他方面自由社会的一些部分，而且这种生活形式——伴随其对个人自由的必要限制——没有理由不能对那些更喜欢它的人开放。实际上，某种军事路线上的自愿劳动服务很可能是国家为全部人提供工作机会的确定性和最低收入的最佳形式。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> That proposals of this sort have in the past proved so little acceptable is due to the fact that those who are willing to surrender their freedom for security have always demanded that if they give up their full freedom it should also be taken from those not prepared to do so. For this claim it is difficult to find a justification.

[译文]
> 这样的提议在过去所以接受度甚低，是因为那些愿意为安全而放弃自由的人总是要求，如果他们放弃自己的充分自由，也应该从那些不准备这样做的人那里夺走自由。对这种要求很难找到理由。<!-- p13.s2 -->

---

## 第十四节：从部分计划到全面强制

[原文]
> The military type of organization as we know it gives us, however, only a very inadequate picture of what it would be like if it were extended to the whole of society. So long as only a part of society is organized on military lines, the unfreedom of the members of the military organization is mitigated by the fact that there is still a free sphere to which they can move if the restrictions become too irksome.

[译文]
> 然而，我们所知的军事组织类型仅为我们提供了一个非常不充分的图景，如果将其扩展到整个社会会是什么样子。只要社会的一部分是按军事路线组织的，军事组织成员的不自由就通过仍然存在一个自由领域使他们能够移动的事实而得到缓解，如果限制变得太令人厌烦。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> If we want to form a picture of what society would be like if, according to the ideal which has seduced so many socialists, it was organized as a single great factory, we have to look to ancient Sparta, or to contemporary Germany, which, after moving for two or three generations in this direction, has now so nearly reached it.

[译文]
> 若我们想要形成一个社会会是什么样子的图景，即如果按照吸引了许多社会主义者的理想被组织为一个单一的大工厂，我们必须看古代斯巴达，或当代德国，后者在这个方向上进行了两三代人的移动之后，现在已经非常接近实现它。<!-- p14.s2 -->

---

## 第十五节：安全的陷阱与自由的消亡

[原文]
> In a society used to freedom it is unlikely that many people would be ready deliberately to purchase security at this price. But the policies which are now followed everywhere, which hand out the privilege of security, now to this group and now to that, are nevertheless rapidly creating conditions in which the striving for security tends to become stronger than the love of freedom.

[译文]
> 在习惯自由的社会中，不太可能有很多人准备以这个代价刻意购买安全。但现在到处遵循的政策，这些政策把安全的特权现在交给这个群体，现在又交给那个群体，然而正在迅速创造条件，在这些条件中，对安全的追求倾向于变得比对自由的热爱更强。<!-- p15.s1 -->

[原文]
> The reason for this is that with every grant of complete security to one group the insecurity of the rest necessarily increases. If you guarantee to some a fixed part of a variable cake, the share left to the rest is bound to fluctuate proportionally more than the size of the whole. And the essential element of security which the competitive system offers, the great variety of opportunities, is more and more reduced.

[译文]
> 这样做的原因是，每次向一个群体授予完全的安全时，其他人的不安全就必然增加。如果你向某些人保证一个可变蛋糕的固定部分，留给其他人的份额必然会比整体的大小波动更多。而竞争体系所提供的安全的基本要素——多种多样的机会——越来越少。<!-- p15.s2 -->

---

## 第十六节：市场内的保护主义与失业

[原文]
> Within the market system, security can be granted to particular groups only by the kind of planning known as restrictionism (which includes, however, almost all the planning which is actually practiced!). "Control," i.e., limitation of output so that prices will secure an "adequate" return, is the only way in which in a market economy producers can be guaranteed a certain income. But this necessarily involves a reduction of opportunities open to others.

[译文]
> 在市场体系中，安全只能通过被称为保护主义的计划类型授予特定群体（虽然这包括几乎所有实际进行的计划！）。"控制"，即限制产出以使价格确保"充分"的回报，是市场经济中生产者被保证某种收入的唯一方式。但这必然涉及减少对他人开放的机会。<!-- p16.s1 -->

[原文]
> If the producer, be he entrepreneur or worker, is to be protected against underbidding by outsiders, it means that others who are worse off are precluded from sharing in the relatively greater prosperity of the controlled industries. Every restriction on the freedom of entry into a trade reduces the security of all those outside it. And, as the number of those whose income is secured in this manner increases, the field of alternative opportunities which are open to anyone who suffers a loss of income is restricted; and for those unfavorably affected by any change the chance of avoiding a fatal diminution of their income is correspondingly diminished.

[译文]
> 若生产者，无论是企业家或工人，要被保护免受外来者的压价，那就意味着其他更困难的人被排除在受控工业的相对更大繁荣之外。每一项对进入一行业的自由的限制都减少了该行业外所有人的安全。而当以这种方式获得收入保障的人数增加时，对于任何遭受收入损失的人开放的替代机会领域就被限制了；而对于被任何改变所不利影响的人来说，避免他们收入致命性减少的机会就相应地减少了。<!-- p16.s2 -->

[原文]
> And if, as has become increasingly true, in each trade in which conditions improve, the members are allowed to exclude others in order to secure to themselves the full gain in the form of higher wages or profits, those in the trades where demand has fallen have nowhere to go, and every change becomes the cause of large unemployment.

[译文]
> 而如果，如同越来越多地变成真实的那样，在每一个条件改善的行业中，成员被允许排除他人以为自己争取全部收益作为更高的工资或利润，那么处于需求下降行业中的人无处可去，而每一个改变都成为大规模失业的原因。<!-- p16.s3 -->

[原文]
> There can be little doubt that it is largely a consequence of the striving for security by these means in the last decades that unemployment and thus insecurity for large sections of the population has so much increased.

[译文]
> 毫无疑问，过去几十年来，通过这些手段追求安全在很大程度上是导致失业以及因此大量人口的不安全大幅增加的原因。<!-- p16.s4 -->

## 第十七节：死板社会的出现与自由的悖论

[原文]
> In England and America such restrictions, especially those affecting the intermediate strata of society, have assumed important dimensions only in comparatively recent times, and we have scarcely yet realized their full consequences. The utter hopelessness of the position of those who, in a society which has thus grown rigid, are left outside the range of sheltered occupation, and the magnitude of the gulf which separates them from the fortunate possessors of jobs for whom protection against competition has made it unnecessary to budge ever so little to make room for those without, can be appreciated only by those who have experienced it.

[译文]
> 在英国和美国，这样的限制，特别是影响社会中间阶层的限制，仅在相对较近的时期才占据了重要的维度，而我们几乎还没有意识到它们的全部后果。在一个这样已经变得死板的社会中，那些被留在受保护职业范围之外的人的完全绝望位置，以及分离他们和那些幸运的拥有工作者的鸿沟的广度——对后者来说，保护免受竞争使其无须稍微移动以为那些没有工作的人腾出地方——只有经历过的人才能欣赏。<!-- p17.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is not a question of the fortunate ones' giving up their places, but merely that they should share in the common misfortune by some reduction of their incomes, or frequently even merely by some sacrifice of their prospects of improvement. The protection of their "standard of life," of the "fair price," or the "professional income" to which they regard themselves as entitled, and in the protection of which they receive the support of the state, precludes this.

[译文]
> 这不是幸运者放弃他们位置的问题，而仅仅是他们应该通过减少他们的收入或频繁仅仅是通过牺牲他们改善前景的某种方式来分担共同的不幸。保护他们的"生活水准"、"公平价格"或他们认为自己有权享受的"专业收入"，以及国家在保护这些方面的支持，使这成为不可能。<!-- p17.s2 -->

[原文]
> In consequence, instead of prices, wages, and individual incomes, it is now employment and production which have become subject to violent fluctuations. There has never been a worse and more cruel exploitation of one class by another than that of the weaker or less fortunate members of a group of producers by the well-established which has been made possible by the "regulation" of competition.

[译文]
> 因此，不再是价格、工资和个人收入，而是现在的就业和生产受到了剧烈波动。没有比由"竞争的调节"所可能的那样，由建立完善的人对较弱或较不幸的生产者群体成员的剥削更坏和更残忍的阶级间的相互剥削。<!-- p17.s3 -->

[原文]
> Few catchwords have done so much harm as the ideal of a "stabilization" of particular prices (or wages), which, while securing the income of some, makes the position of the rest more and more precarious.

[译文]
> 没有几个口号比"稳定"特定价格（或工资）的理想造成过如此多的伤害，虽然它确保了某些人的收入，但却使其他人的位置越来越危险。<!-- p17.s4 -->

---

## 第十八节：不安全的加剧与社会价值观的反转

[原文]
> Thus, the more we try to provide full security by interfering with the market system, the greater the insecurity becomes; and, what is worse, the greater becomes the contrast between the security of those to whom it is granted as a privilege and the ever increasing insecurity of the underprivileged. And the more security becomes a privilege, and the greater the danger to those excluded from it, the higher will security be prized.

[译文]
> 因此，我们越是试图通过干预市场体系来提供充分的安全，不安全就变得越大；而且，更糟的是，那些被授予安全作为特权的人与不断增加的被剥夺特权者的不安全之间的对比变得越大。而且安全越是变成一个特权，那些被排除在其外的人所面临的危险就越大，安全被重视的程度就越高。<!-- p18.s1 -->

[原文]
> As the number of the privileged increases and the difference between their security and the insecurity of the others increases, a completely new set of social values gradually arises. It is no longer independence but security which gives rank and status, the certain right to a pension more than confidence in his making good which makes a young man eligible for marriage, while insecurity becomes the dreaded state of the pariah in which those who in their youth have been refused admission to the haven of a salaried position remain for life.

[译文]
> 随着特权者人数的增加和他们的安全与他人的不安全之间差异的增加，一套完全新的社会价值观逐渐产生。不再是独立而是安全给予等级和地位，一份养老金的确定权利比对青年人适合结婚所需的成功的信心更为重要，而不安全变成了贱民的可怕状态，那些在青年时代被拒绝进入薪资职位的避风港的人在这种状态中终生停留。<!-- p18.s2 -->

---

## 第十九节：德国模式与官僚国家的教训

[原文]
> The general endeavor to achieve security by restrictive measures, tolerated or supported by the state, has in the course of time produced a progressive transformation of society—a transformation in which, as in so many other ways, Germany has led and the other countries have followed. This development has been hastened by another effect of socialist teaching, the deliberate disparagement of all activities involving economic risk and the moral opprobrium cast on the gains which make risks worth taking but which only few can win.

[译文]
> 通过国家容忍或支持的限制措施追求安全的普遍努力，随着时间的推移，产生了社会的逐步转变——在这种转变中，如同许多其他方面一样，德国走在前面，其他国家紧随其后。社会主义教学的另一个影响加快了这一发展，即对所有涉及经济风险的活动的刻意贬低，以及对使风险值得承担但只有少数人能赢的收益的道德污名。<!-- p19.s1 -->

[原文]
> We cannot blame our young men when they prefer the safe, salaried position to the risk of enterprise after they have heard from their earliest youth the former described as the superior, more unselfish and disinterested occupation. The younger generation of today has grown up in a world in which in school and press the spirit of commercial enterprise has been represented as disreputable and the making of profit as immoral, where to employ a hundred people is represented as exploitation but to command the same number as honorable.

[译文]
> 当我们的年轻人从最早的青年时期就听到前者被描述为更高尚、更无私和更公正的职业时，当他们更喜欢安全的薪资职位而非企业的风险时，我们不能责怪他们。今天的年轻一代在学校和新闻中商业企业精神被代表为不光彩、利润的获取被代表为不道德、雇用一百人被代表为剥削但指挥相同数量的人被代表为光荣的世界中长大。<!-- p19.s2 -->

[原文]
> Older people may regard this as an exaggeration of the present state of affairs, but the daily experience of the university teacher leaves little doubt that, as a result of anticapitalist propaganda, values have already altered far in advance of the change in institutions which has so far taken place. The question is whether, by changing our institutions to satisfy the new demands, we shall not unwittingly destroy values which we still rate higher.

[译文]
> 年长的人可能会将此视为对现状的夸大，但大学教师的日常经历几乎无法怀疑，作为反资本主义宣传的结果，价值观已经在远超迄今为止发生的制度改变的程度上改变了。问题是，我们是否会通过改变我们的制度来满足新的要求，无意中摧毁我们仍然更重视的价值观。<!-- p19.s3 -->

---

## 第二十节：德国"官僚国家"的本质与英国的对比

[原文]
> The change in the structure of society involved in the victory of the ideal of security over that of independence cannot be better illustrated than by a comparison of what ten or twenty years ago could still be regarded as the English and the German type of society. However great the influence of the army may have been in the latter country, it is a grave mistake to ascribe what the Englishman regarded as the "military" character of German society mainly to that influence.

[译文]
> 安全理想对独立理想的胜利所涉及的社会结构改变不能比通过对十或二十年前仍可被视为英国和德国社会类型的比较更好地说明。无论德国军队的影响有多大，将英国人所认为的德国社会的"军事"特征主要归因于那种影响是一个严重的错误。<!-- p20.s1 -->

[原文]
> The difference went much deeper than could be explained on that ground, and the peculiar attributes of German society existed no less in circles in which the properly military influence was negligible than in those in which it was strong. It was not so much that at almost all times a larger part of the German people was organized for war than was true in other countries, but that the same type of organization was employed for so many other purposes, which gave German society its peculiar character.

[译文]
> 差异的深度远超能在那个基础上解释的程度，而德国社会的特殊属性在军事影响可忽略不计的圈子中并不比影响强烈的圈子中存在得少。问题不那么在于几乎在所有时期德国人民的更大部分被组织为战争状态比在其他国家更真实，而在于同一种组织类型被用于许多其他目的，这给了德国社会其特殊的性质。<!-- p20.s2 -->

[原文]
> It was that a larger part of the civil life of Germany than of any other country was deliberately organized from the top, that so large a proportion of her people did not regard themselves as independent but as appointed functionaries, which gave her social structure its peculiar character. Germany had, as the Germans themselves boasted, for long been a Beamtenstaat in which not only in the civil service proper but in almost all spheres of life income and status were assigned and guaranteed by some authority.

[译文]
> 关键是德国的民事生活比任何其他国家的更大部分被自上而下地刻意组织，那么大比例的其人民不把自己视为独立的而是把自己视为被任命的职员，这给了其社会结构其特殊的性质。如德国人自己吹嘘的那样，德国长期以来一直是一个"官僚国家"，在这个国家中不仅在公务系统本身而且在几乎所有的生活领域中，收入和地位都由某种权力机构分配和担保。<!-- p20.s3 -->

## 第二十一节：自由精神的逐步窒息与牺牲的困境

[原文]
> While it is doubtful whether the spirit of freedom can anywhere be extirpated by force, it is not certain that any people would successfully withstand the process by which it was slowly smothered in Germany. Where distinction and rank are achieved almost exclusively by becoming a salaried servant of the state, where to do one's assigned duty is regarded as more laudable than to choose one's own field of usefulness, where all pursuits that do not give a recognized place in the official hierarchy or a claim to a fixed income are regarded as inferior and even somewhat disreputable, it is too much to expect that many will long prefer freedom to security.

[译文]
> 虽然怀疑自由精神是否能被任何地方的武力根除是有道理的，但不确定任何人民是否能够成功地抵抗它在德国被缓慢窒息的过程。在那里，区别和等级几乎完全通过成为国家的薪资仆人来获得，在那里执行被任命的责任被视为比选择自己有用的领域更值得赞赏，在那里所有不给予在官员等级中公认位置或对固定收入的索赔的追求都被视为低等的甚至有点不光彩的，期望许多人将长期更喜欢自由而非安全太过分了。<!-- p21.s1 -->

[原文]
> And where the alternative to security in a dependent position is a most precarious position, in which one is despised alike for success and for failure, only few will resist the temptation of safety at the price of freedom. Once things have gone so far, liberty indeed becomes almost a mockery, since it can be purchased only by the sacrifice of most of the good things of this earth.

[译文]
> 而在那里，对依赖位置中安全的替代是一个最不稳定的位置，一个人同样因成功和失败而被鄙视，只有少数人会抵抗以自由为代价的安全的诱惑。一旦事情发展到如此地步，自由确实几乎成了一个嘲笑，因为它只能通过牺牲地球上大多数好东西来获得。<!-- p21.s2 -->

---

## 第二十二节：自由的代价与富兰克林的警告

[原文]
> In this state it is little surprising that more and more people should come to feel that without economic security liberty is "not worth having" and that they are willing to sacrifice their liberty for security. But it is disquieting to find Professor Harold Laski employing the very same argument which has perhaps done more than any other to induce the German people to sacrifice their liberty.

[译文]
> 在这种状态下，越来越多的人开始感到没有经济安全自由就"不值得拥有"，他们愿意为安全而牺牲自由，这不足为奇。但令人不安的是发现哈罗德·拉斯基教授采用了同样的论证，这个论证可能比其他任何论证都更多地促使德国人民放弃了他们的自由。<!-- p22.s1 -->

[原文]
> There can be no question that adequate security against severe privation, and the reduction of the avoidable causes of misdirected effort and consequent disappointment, will have to be one of the main goals of policy. But if these endeavors are to be successful and are not to destroy individual freedom, security must be provided outside the market and competition be left to function unobstructed.

[译文]
> 毫无疑问，防止严重贫困的充分安全，以及减少导致错误努力和随之而来失望的可避免原因，必须成为政策的主要目标之一。但如果这些努力要成功并且不摧毁个人自由，安全必须在市场外提供，而竞争应该被留下来无阻碍地发挥功能。<!-- p22.s2 -->

[原文]
> Some security is essential if freedom is to be preserved, because most men are willing to bear the risk which freedom inevitably involves only so long as that risk is not too great. But while this is a truth of which we must never lose sight, nothing is more fatal than the present fashion among intellectual leaders of extolling security at the expense of freedom.

[译文]
> 如果要保护自由，某种安全是必要的，因为大多数人只有在自由必然涉及的风险不太大的情况下才愿意承担这种风险。但虽然这是一个我们绝不能失去视线的真理，但没有什么比当前知识领袖中以自由为代价颂扬安全的时尚更致命的。<!-- p22.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is essential that we should relearn frankly to face the fact that freedom can be had only at a price and that as individuals we must be prepared to make severe material sacrifices to preserve our liberty. If we want to retain this, we must regain the conviction on which the rule of liberty in the Anglo-Saxon countries has been based and which Benjamin Franklin expressed in a phrase applicable to us in our lives as individuals no less than as nations: "Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."

[译文]
> 必不可少的是，我们应该坦率地重新学会面对这样一个事实，即自由只能以代价换得，而作为个人我们必须准备好做出严重的物质牺牲来保护我们的自由。若我们想要保留这一点，我们必须重新获得盎格鲁-撒克逊国家自由统治的基础所建立的信念，以及本杰明·富兰克林用一句对我们作为个人而不仅作为民族都同样适用的措辞所表达的信念："那些愿意放弃基本自由以换得一点点临时安全的人既不值得拥有自由也不值得拥有安全。"<!-- p22.s4 -->

[注-原-3] There are also serious problems of international relations which arise if mere citizenship of a country confers the right to a standard of living higher than elsewhere and which ought not to be dismissed too lightly.

[注-原-4] Hayek here refers to policies that would later carry the label "Keynesian" demand management policies.

[注-原-5] Very interesting suggestions of how these hardships might be mitigated within a liberal society have been put forward by Professor W. H. Hutt in a book which will repay careful study, W. H. Hutt, Plan for Reconstruction: A Project for Victory in War and Peace (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Co., 1943).

[注-原-8] Beamtenstaat might be translated as "civil service state," though if used pejoratively, as Hayek here suggests might be appropriate, it might also be rendered "bureaucratic state."

Laski, Liberty in the Modern State (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books Ltd., 1937), Pelican Books ed., p. 51: "Those who know the normal life of the poor, its haunting sense of impending disaster, its fitful search for beauty which perpetually eludes, will realise well enough that, without economic security, liberty is not worth having."

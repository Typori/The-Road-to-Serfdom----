# 计划的"不可避免性"

> 摘要：本章批驳"技术进步使计划不可避免"的论调，揭示垄断与计划的兴起源于刻意的政策而非客观必然，并论证竞争机制在复杂经济中的不可替代性。

## 第一节：技术进步与计划需求的谬误

[原文]
> It is a revealing fact that few planners are content to say that central planning is desirable. Most of them affirm that we can no longer choose but are compelled by circumstances beyond our control to substitute planning for competition. <!-- p1.s1 -->

[译文]
很少有计划者仅仅声称中央计划是可取的而感到满足。大多数人的主张要强硬得多——他们断言，我们已经无法选择，而是被超越我们控制范围的客观条件所迫，不得不用计划取代竞争。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> The myth is deliberately cultivated that we are embarking on the new course not out of free will but because competition is spontaneously eliminated by technological changes which we neither can reverse nor should wish to prevent. This argument is rarely developed at any length—it is one of the assertions taken over by one writer from another until, by mere iteration, it has come to be accepted as an established fact. It is, nevertheless, devoid of foundation. <!-- p1.s2 -->

[译文]
这一观点被人为地精心培育：我们走上新道路，不是出于自由意志，而是因为竞争被技术进步自发地淘汰了——而这种技术进步是我们既无法扭转、也不应试图阻止的。这个论证很少得到充分展开，不过是作家们相互转述的一个断言，经过反复传播，最终被当作既定的事实接受了。然而事实上，它完全缺乏根据。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> The tendency toward monopoly and planning is not the result of any "objective facts" beyond our control but the product of opinions fostered and propagated for half a century until they have come to dominate all our policy. <!-- p1.s3 -->

[译文]
走向垄断和计划的这种趋势，并非源于任何超出我们控制的"客观事实"，而是半个世纪以来被培育和传播的观念的产物。这些观念最终掌控了我们的政策取向。<!-- p1.s3 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> Of the various arguments employed to demonstrate the inevitability of planning, the one most frequently heard is that technological changes have made competition impossible in a constantly increasing number of fields and that the only choice left to us is between control of production by private monopolies and direction by the government. <!-- p2.s1 -->

[译文]
在用来论证计划不可避免性的各种论据中，最常听到的一个主张是：技术变革已使竞争在越来越多的产业中变得不可能，留给我们的唯一出路就是在私人垄断对生产的控制和政府的直接管制之间作出抉择。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> This belief derives mainly from the Marxist doctrine of the "concentration of industry," although, like so many Marxist ideas, it is now found in many circles which have received it at third or fourth hand and do not know whence it derives. <!-- p2.s2 -->

[译文]
这种信念主要源自马克思主义的"产业集中"学说。不过和许多马克思主义观念一样，它现在在许多圈子里流行，而这些圈子往往是辗转传播得来的，其追随者甚至不知道其来源。<!-- p2.s2 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> The historical fact of the progressive growth of monopoly during the last fifty years and the increasing restriction of the field in which competition rules is, of course, not disputed—although the extent of the phenomenon is often greatly exaggerated.[注-原-2] <!-- p3.s1 -->

[译文]
过去五十年间垄断逐步增长、竞争领域日益缩小这一历史事实自然不容否认——不过这种现象的程度往往被大大夸大了。[注-原-2] <!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> The important question is whether this development is a necessary consequence of the advance of technology or whether it is simply the result of the policies pursued in most countries. We shall presently see that the actual history of this development strongly suggests the latter. But we must first consider in how far modern technological developments are of such a kind as to make the growth of monopolies in wide fields inevitable. <!-- p3.s2 -->

[译文]
真正的问题是：这种现象是技术进步的必然结果，还是仅仅是大多数国家所采取政策的产物？我们稍后会看到，这一发展的实际历史强烈表明是后者。但在此之前，我们首先需要考察：现代技术进步在多大程度上会必然导致垄断在广泛领域的增长。<!-- p3.s2 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> The alleged technological cause of the growth of monopoly is the superiority of the large firm over the small, owing to the greater efficiency of modern methods of mass production. <!-- p4.s1 -->

[译文]
人们常说的垄断增长的技术根源是这样一个原理：大企业因采用现代大规模生产方法而比小企业更有效率，因此天然占有优势。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> Modern methods, it is asserted, have created conditions in the majority of industries where the production of the large firm can be increased at decreasing costs per unit, with the result that the large firms are everywhere underbidding and driving out the small ones; this process must go on until in each industry only one or at most a few giant firms are left. <!-- p4.s2 -->

[译文]
据说，现代生产方法在大多数产业中创造了这样的条件：大企业的产量越大，单位成本反而越低。结果是大企业四处压低价格，小企业纷纷被挤出市场。这个过程必然持续下去，直到每个产业最后只剩下一家或少数几家巨型企业。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> This argument singles out one effect sometimes accompanying technological progress; it disregards others which work in the opposite direction; and it receives little support from a serious study of the facts. <!-- p4.s3 -->

[译文]
这个论证只强调了有时伴随技术进步出现的一种效应，却完全无视其他朝相反方向作用的因素。对事实的严肃研究几乎没有为这个论证提供支持。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> We cannot here investigate this question in detail and must be content to accept the best evidence available. <!-- p4.s4 -->

[译文]
我们无法在这里详细展开这个问题，只能基于现有的最佳证据。<!-- p4.s4 -->

[原文]
> The most comprehensive study of the facts undertaken in recent times is that by the Temporary National Economic Committee on the Concentration of Economic Power. The final report of this committee (which certainly cannot be accused of an undue liberal bias) arrives at the conclusion that the view according to which the greater efficiency of large-scale production is the cause of the disappearance of competition "finds scant support in any evidence that is now at hand."[注-原-3] <!-- p4.s5 -->

[译文]
近年来对此进行的最全面研究来自美国临时全国经济委员会关于经济权力集中的调查。该委员会的最终报告（这个委员会显然不会被批评有自由主义偏见）得出了这样的结论：认为大规模生产的更高效率是竞争消失原因的观点，"在目前掌握的任何证据中几乎得不到支持"。[注-原-3] <!-- p4.s5 -->

[原文]
> And the detailed monograph on the question which was prepared for the committee sums up the answer in this statement: <!-- p4.s6 -->

[译文]
为该委员会准备的详细专题著作对这个问题作出了如下总结：<!-- p4.s6 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> "The superior efficiency of large establishments has not been demonstrated; the advantages that are supposed to destroy competition have failed to manifest themselves in many fields. Nor do the economies of size, where they exist, invariably necessitate monopoly. . . . The size or the sizes of the optimum efficiency may be reached long before the major part of a supply is subjected to such control. The conclusions that the advantage of large-scale production must lead inevitably to the abolition of competition cannot be accepted. It should be noted, moreover, that monopoly is frequently the product of factors other than the lower costs of greater size. It is attained through collusive agreement and promoted by public policies. When these agreements are invalidated and when these policies are reversed, competitive conditions can be restored."[注-原-4] <!-- p5.s1 -->

[译文]
"大型企业的优越效率并未得到证明；那些声称能够摧毁竞争的优势，在许多领域并未体现。即便规模经济确实存在，也并非必然导致垄断……最优效率的规模往往在供应的大部分受到这种控制之前很久就已达到。因此，大规模生产的优势必然导致竞争消亡这一结论是不能接受的。还需指出的是，垄断往往不是源于更大规模带来的更低成本，而是源于其他因素。垄断是通过共谋协议达成的，并由公共政策推动。只要这些协议被宣告无效、这些政策被改变，竞争条件就能恢复。"[注-原-4] <!-- p5.s1 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> An investigation of conditions in England would lead to very similar results. Anyone who has observed how aspiring monopolists regularly seek and frequently obtain the assistance of the power of the state to make their control effective can have little doubt that there is nothing inevitable about this development. <!-- p6.s1 -->

[译文]
对英国情况的考察会得出非常相似的结论。任何曾观察到那些有志于垄断的企业如何经常寻求、也频繁获得国家权力帮助来巩固其控制的人，都不会怀疑这一发展中有什么必然性。<!-- p6.s1 -->

&nbsp;

## 第二节：垄断问题的根源

[原文]
> This conclusion is strongly supported by the historical order in which the decline of competition and the growth of monopoly manifested themselves in different countries. <!-- p7.s1 -->

[译文]
竞争衰退和垄断增长在不同国家出现的历史顺序，有力地支持了这一结论。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> If they were the result of technological developments or a necessary product of the evolution of "capitalism," we should expect them to appear first in the countries with the most advanced economic system. In fact, they appeared first during the last third of the nineteenth century in what were then comparatively young industrial countries, the United States and Germany. <!-- p7.s2 -->

[译文]
如果这些现象是技术发展的结果，或"资本主义"演化的必然产物，我们应该期待它们首先出现在经济制度最发达的国家。实际上，它们首先出现在十九世纪最后三十年间那些当时还相对年轻的工业国家：美国和德国。<!-- p7.s2 -->

[原文]
> In the latter country especially, which came to be regarded as the model country typifying the necessary evolution of capitalism, the growth of cartels and syndicates has since 1878 been systematically fostered by deliberate policy. Not only the instrument of protection but direct inducements and ultimately compulsion were used by the governments to further the creation of monopolies for the regulation of prices and sales. <!-- p7.s3 -->

[译文]
尤其在德国——它后来被奉为典范，被认为代表了资本主义必然演化的道路——自1878年以来，卡特尔和辛迪加的增长就被系统地、有意地推动。政府不仅使用关税壁垒，还动用了直接激励，最终甚至采用强制手段，来促进垄断组织的建立，以便对价格和销售进行调控。<!-- p7.s3 -->

[原文]
> It was here that, with the help of the state, the first great experiment in "scientific planning" and "conscious organization of industry" led to the creation of giant monopolies, which were represented as inevitable growths fifty years before the same was done in Great Britain. <!-- p7.s4 -->

[译文]
正是在这里，在国家的扶持下，"科学计划"和"有意识的产业组织"进行了首次大规模实验，导致巨型垄断的产生。这些垄断被描绘成历史的必然产物——比同样的事在英国发生早了五十年。<!-- p7.s4 -->

[原文]
> It is largely due to the influence of German socialist theoreticians, particularly Sombart, generalizing from the experience of their country, that the inevitable development of the competitive system into "monopoly capitalism" became widely accepted.[注-原-5] <!-- p7.s5 -->

[译文]
正因为德国社会主义理论家——特别是桑巴特——从本国经验中总结推广这些结论，竞争制度向"垄断资本主义"必然演化这一观点才被广泛接受。[注-原-5] <!-- p7.s5 -->

[原文]
> That in the United States a highly protectionist policy made a somewhat similar development possible seemed to confirm this generalization. The development of Germany, however, more than that of the United States, came to be regarded as representative of a universal tendency; and it became a commonplace to speak—to quote a widely read political essay of recent date—of "Germany where all the social and political forces of modern civilization have reached their most advanced form."[注-原-6] <!-- p7.s6 -->

[译文]
美国的高度保护主义政策使类似的现象成为可能，这似乎证实了这种推广。然而德国的发展——更甚于美国——被认为代表了一种普遍的历史趋势。因此，用一篇近期流传甚广的政论文章的说法，人们开始笃定地谈论"那个所有现代文明的社会和政治力量都已达到最先进形式的国家——德国"。[注-原-6] <!-- p7.s6 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> How little there was of inevitability in all this, and how much is the result of deliberate policy, becomes clear when we consider the position in England until 1931 and the development since that year in which Great Britain also embarked upon a policy of general protection.[注-原-7] <!-- p8.s1 -->

[译文]
只要看一下英国直到1931年的状况，以及自该年英国也开始实行普遍保护性关税政策以来的发展，就清楚地看到：这一切有多少是出于刻意选择，又有多少真的是不可避免。[注-原-7] <!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is only a dozen years since, except for a few industries which had obtained protection earlier, British industry was on the whole as competitive as, perhaps, at any time in its history. <!-- p8.s2 -->

[译文]
仅仅十几年前，英国产业——除了少数早先获得保护的产业外——就整体而言仍然保持着其历史上最富竞争性的状态。<!-- p8.s2 -->

[原文]
> And, although during the 1920s it suffered severely from incompatible policies followed with regard to wages and to money, at least the years up to 1929 compare with regard to employment and general activity not unfavorably with the 1930s. <!-- p8.s3 -->

[译文]
虽然1920年代的英国因在工资和货币政策上采取的相互矛盾的举措而蒙受重创，但至少到1929年为止的那段时期，在就业和总体经济活动上并不比1930年代更差。<!-- p8.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is only since the transition to protection and the general change in British economic policy accompanying it that the growth of monopolies has proceeded at an amazing rate and has transformed British industry to an extent the public has scarcely yet realized. <!-- p8.s4 -->

[译文]
正是自从英国转向保护主义、随之而来的经济政策全面调整以后，垄断的增长才以惊人的速度进行，将英国产业改造到公众几乎还未完全意识到的程度。<!-- p8.s4 -->

[原文]
> To argue that this development has anything to do with the technological progress during this period, that technological necessities which in Germany operated in the 1880s and 1890s, made themselves felt here in the 1930s, is not much less absurd than the claim, implied in a statement of Mussolini, that Italy had to abolish individual freedom before other European people because its civilization had marched so far in advance of the rest! <!-- p8.s5 -->

[译文]
若说这一发展与这一时期的技术进步有什么关系，说在德国1880-1890年代的技术必然性到1930年代才在英国显现，这几乎和墨索里尼暗示的那个主张一样荒唐——意大利必须比其他欧洲民族更早废除个人自由，因为它的文明已经遥遥领先！<!-- p8.s5 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> In so far as England is concerned, the thesis that the change in opinion and policy merely follows an inexorable change in the facts can be given a certain appearance of truth, just because the nation has followed at a distance the intellectual developments elsewhere. <!-- p9.s1 -->

[译文]
就英国而言，观念和政策的改变仅仅跟随客观事实的不可逆转变化这一论点，之所以似乎有一定道理，只是因为英国在时间上落后于其他地方的思想发展。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> It could thus be argued that monopolistic organization of industry grew up in spite of the fact that public opinion still favored competition but that outside events frustrated their wishes. <!-- p9.s2 -->

[译文]
因此可以论证，虽然公众舆论仍然支持竞争，但产业垄断组织还是发展起来了，似乎是外部事件挫败了人们的愿望。<!-- p9.s2 -->

[原文]
> The true relation between theory and practice becomes, however, clear as soon as we look to the prototype of this development—Germany. <!-- p9.s3 -->

[译文]
然而，只要看一眼这一发展的原型——德国——理论与实践之间的真实关系就会变得清晰起来。<!-- p9.s3 -->

[原文]
> That there the suppression of competition was a matter of deliberate policy, that it was undertaken in the service of the ideal which we now call planning, there can be no doubt. <!-- p9.s4 -->

[译文]
在那里，压制竞争明确是刻意的政策选择，是为了服务于我们现在称之为"计划"的理想而进行的——这一点毫无疑问。<!-- p9.s4 -->

[原文]
> In the progressive advance toward a completely planned society the Germans, and all the people who are imitating their example, are merely following the course which nineteenth-century thinkers, particularly Germans, have mapped out for them. <!-- p9.s5 -->

[译文]
德国人及所有模仿它的国家，在逐步走向完全计划的社会过程中，不过是沿着十九世纪思想家——特别是德国思想家——为他们规划的道路行进。<!-- p9.s5 -->

[原文]
> The intellectual history of the last sixty or eighty years is indeed a perfect illustration of the truth that in social evolution nothing is inevitable but thinking makes it so. <!-- p9.s6 -->

[译文]
过去六七十年的思想史，完美地证明了一个深刻的真理：在社会演化中，没有什么是真正不可避免的，是思想让一切变得不可避免。<!-- p9.s6 -->

&nbsp;

## 第三节：竞争的可能性与条件

[原文]
> The assertion that modern technological progress makes planning inevitable can also be interpreted in a different manner. It may mean that the complexity of our modern industrial civilization creates new problems with which we cannot hope to deal effectively except by central planning. <!-- p10.s1 -->

[译文]
"现代技术进步使计划不可避免"这一论断还可以从另一种角度理解。它可能是说：现代工业文明的复杂性产生了新问题，我们除了依靠中央计划，无法指望有效地处理这些问题。<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> In a sense this is true—yet not in the wide sense in which it is claimed. <!-- p10.s2 -->

[译文]
这在某种程度上是对的——但不是在通常理解的那么广泛的意义上。<!-- p10.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is, for example, a commonplace that many of the problems created by a modern town, like many other problems caused by close contiguity in space, are not adequately solved by competition. But it is not these problems, like those of the "public utilities," etc., which are uppermost in the minds of those who invoke the complexity of modern civilization as an argument for central planning. <!-- p10.s3 -->

[译文]
诚然，现代城市产生的许多问题——以及空间相邻而产生的许多其他问题——不能单纯依靠竞争充分解决，这是众所周知的。但援引现代文明复杂性来论证中央计划必要性的人，心中最关切的并非诸如"公用事业"这类问题。<!-- p10.s3 -->

[原文]
> What they generally suggest is that the increasing difficulty of obtaining a coherent picture of the complete economic process makes it indispensable that things should be coordinated by some central agency if social life is not to dissolve in chaos. <!-- p10.s4 -->

[译文]
他们通常的主张是：获得完整经济图景的难度日益增大，使得必须由某个中央机构来协调事务，否则社会生活就会陷入混乱。<!-- p10.s4 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> This argument is based on a complete misapprehension of the working of competition. <!-- p11.s1 -->

[译文]
这个论证基于对竞争如何运作的根本性误解。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> Far from being appropriate only to comparatively simple conditions, it is the very complexity of the division of labor under modern conditions which makes competition the only method by which such coordination can be adequately brought about. <!-- p11.s2 -->

[译文]
竞争恰恰不是仅适用于简单条件的机制。恰恰是现代条件下分工的复杂性，使得竞争成为唯一能够充分实现这种协调的方法。<!-- p11.s2 -->

[原文]
> There would be no difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant facts. <!-- p11.s3 -->

[译文]
如果条件简单到一个人或一个委员会就能有效掌握所有相关信息，那么有效的管制或计划就不会有什么困难。<!-- p11.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them that decentralization becomes imperative. <!-- p11.s4 -->

[译文]
只有当必须考虑的因素变得如此众多，以至于不可能获得全面的图景时，分权才成为必然。<!-- p11.s4 -->

[原文]
> But, once decentralization is necessary, the problem of coordination arises—a coordination which leaves the separate agencies free to adjust their activities to the facts which only they can know and yet brings about a mutual adjustment of their respective plans. <!-- p11.s5 -->

[译文]
一旦分权成为必要，协调问题就随之产生——这种协调既要让各个独立的行为体根据只有它们才能掌握的具体情况自由调整其行动，又要实现它们各自计划的相互协调。<!-- p11.s5 -->

[原文]
> As decentralization has become necessary because nobody can consciously balance all the considerations bearing on the decisions of so many individuals, the coordination can clearly be effected not by "conscious control" but only by arrangements which convey to each agent the information he must possess in order effectively to adjust his decisions to those of others. <!-- p11.s6 -->

[译文]
既然分权之所以必要是因为没人能够有意识地权衡涉及众多个人决策的所有因素，那么协调显然不能通过"有意识的控制"来实现，而只能通过一种系统性的安排来实现：这种安排能将每个行为体进行有效决策所必需的信息传递给他。<!-- p11.s6 -->

[原文]
> And because all the details of the changes constantly affecting the conditions of demand and supply of the different commodities can never be fully known, or quickly enough be collected and disseminated, by any one center, what is required is some apparatus of registration which automatically records all the relevant effects of individual actions and whose indications are at the same time the resultant of, and the guide for, all the individual decisions. <!-- p11.s7 -->

[译文]
而且，由于不断影响各种商品供求条件的具体变化，永远无法被任何一个中心完全掌握，也无法被足够迅速地收集和传播，因此需要某种自动记录装置——它能够自动记录个人行动的所有相关影响，其数据既反映了所有个人决策的结果，又成为引导这些决策的指标。<!-- p11.s7 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> This is precisely what the price system does under competition, and which no other system even promises to accomplish. <!-- p12.s1 -->

[译文]
这正是竞争条件下价格体系所做的事情，而没有任何其他体系甚至声称能够做到。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> It enables entrepreneurs, by watching the movement of comparatively few prices, as an engineer watches the hands of a few dials, to adjust their activities to those of their fellows. <!-- p12.s2 -->

[译文]
它使企业家能够通过观察相对较少数量的价格变动——就像工程师看着几个表盘指针一样——将自己的活动调整得与其他人相适应。<!-- p12.s2 -->

[原文]
> The important point here is that the price system will fulfill this function only if competition prevails, that is, if the individual producer has to adapt himself to price changes and cannot control them. <!-- p12.s3 -->

[译文]
这里的关键是：价格体系只有在竞争盛行的条件下才能履行这一功能，也就是说，个别生产者必须被迫适应价格变化，而不能操纵价格。<!-- p12.s3 -->

[原文]
> The more complicated the whole, the more dependent we become on that division of knowledge between individuals whose separate efforts are coordinated by the impersonal mechanism for transmitting the relevant information known by us as the price system. <!-- p12.s4 -->

[译文]
整个经济体系越是复杂，我们就越依赖于个人之间的知识分工——这种分工中各个人的努力通过一个非人格性的信息传递机制得到协调，这个机制就是我们所说的价格体系。<!-- p12.s4 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> It is no exaggeration to say that if we had had to rely on conscious central planning for the growth of our industrial system, it would never have reached the degree of differentiation, complexity, and flexibility it has attained. <!-- p13.s1 -->

[译文]
不夸张地说，如果我们的工业体系的发展不得不依靠有意识的中央计划，它永远不会达到今天所拥有的分化程度、复杂性和灵活性。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> Compared with this method of solving the economic problem by means of decentralization plus automatic coordination, the more obvious method of central direction is incredibly clumsy, primitive, and limited in scope. <!-- p13.s2 -->

[译文]
与这种通过分权加自动协调来解决经济问题的方法相比，更直观的中央指导方法，显得不可思议地笨拙、原始和狭隘。<!-- p13.s2 -->

[原文]
> That the division of labor has reached the extent which makes modern civilization possible we owe to the fact that it did not have to be consciously created but that man tumbled on a method by which the division of labor could be extended far beyond the limits within which it could have been planned. <!-- p13.s3 -->

[译文]
分工之所以能够发展到使现代文明成为可能的程度，我们要感谢的是一个事实：它无需有意识地创造，人类恰恰巧合地发现了一种方法，通过这种方法，分工可以扩展到远远超出任何人为计划可能达到的限度。<!-- p13.s3 -->

[原文]
> Any further growth of its complexity, therefore, far from making central direction more necessary, makes it more important than ever that we should use a technique which does not depend on conscious control. <!-- p13.s4 -->

[译文]
因此，其复杂性的进一步增长，非但不会使中央指导变得更加必要，反而使得我们比以往任何时候都更需要采用一种不依赖于有意识控制的技术。<!-- p13.s4 -->

&nbsp;

## 第四节：计划的真正动机

[原文]
> There is yet another theory which connects the growth of monopolies with technological progress, and which uses arguments almost opposite to those we have just considered; though not often clearly stated, it has also exercised considerable influence. <!-- p14.s1 -->

[译文]
还有另一种理论将垄断的增长与技术进步联系起来，所用的论据几乎与刚才的完全相反。虽然这种理论不常被清晰阐述，但它也产生了相当大的影响。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> It contends not that modern technique destroys competition but that, on the contrary, it will be impossible to make use of many of the new technological possibilities unless protection against competition is granted, i.e., a monopoly is conferred. <!-- p14.s2 -->

[译文]
它主张的不是现代技术摧毁竞争，而是相反：许多新的技术可能性无法利用，除非给予对竞争的保护，也就是说，必须授予垄断地位。<!-- p14.s2 -->

[原文]
> This type of argument is not necessarily fraudulent, as the critical reader will perhaps suspect: the obvious answer—that if a new technique for satisfying our wants is really better, it ought to be able to stand up against all competition—does not dispose of all instances to which this argument refers. <!-- p14.s3 -->

[译文]
这类论证不一定都是欺骗性的，尽管批判性的读者可能会这样怀疑。显而易见的反驳——如果满足需求的新技术真的更好，就应该能经受住竞争——并未能涵盖这种论证所指涉的所有情况。<!-- p14.s3 -->

[原文]
> No doubt in many cases it is used merely as a form of special pleading by interested parties. Even more often it is probably based on a confusion between technical excellence from a narrow engineering point of view and desirability from the point of view of society as a whole. <!-- p14.s4 -->

[译文]
毫无疑问，在许多情况下，它仅仅被利益相关方用来作特殊辩护。更常见的是，它混淆了狭隘工程意义上的技术卓越与整个社会意义上的可取性。<!-- p14.s4 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> There remains, however, a group of instances where the argument has some force. <!-- p15.s1 -->

[译文]
然而，确实存在一些情况，这个论证具有一定的说服力。<!-- p15.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is, for example, at least conceivable that the British automobile industry might be able to supply a car cheaper and better than cars used to be in the United States if everyone in England were made to use the same kind of car or that the use of electricity for all purposes could be made cheaper than coal or gas if everybody could be made to use only electricity. <!-- p15.s2 -->

[译文]
比如说，如果强制英国所有人使用同一种汽车，英国汽车工业可能确实能提供比美国过去的汽车更便宜更好的汽车；或者如果强制所有人只使用电力，电力比煤气可能会更便宜。这些都是可以想象的。<!-- p15.s2 -->

[原文]
> In instances like these it is at least possible that we might all be better off and should prefer the new situation if we had the choice—but that no individual ever gets the choice, because the alternative is either that we should all use the same cheap car (or all should use only electricity) or that we should have the choice between these things with each of them at a much higher price. <!-- p15.s3 -->

[译文]
在这样的情况下，确实有可能我们整体上会过得更好，如果有得选的话我们应该更喜欢新局面——但问题在于，个人永远得不到这个选择机会。因为选择只有两种：要么我们都被迫使用同样的廉价汽车（或都被迫只用电力），要么我们有选择，但每个选项的价格都高得多。<!-- p15.s3 -->

[原文]
> I do not know whether this is true in either of the instances given. But it must be admitted that it is possible that, by compulsory standardization or the prohibition of variety beyond a certain degree, abundance might be increased in some fields more than sufficiently to compensate for the restriction of the choice of the consumer. <!-- p15.s4 -->

[译文]
我不知道以上任何一个例子是否符合事实。但必须承认，通过强制标准化或禁止超过一定程度的多样性，确实有可能在某些领域增加的丰富程度足以弥补消费者选择受限的损失。<!-- p15.s4 -->

[原文]
> It is even conceivable that a new invention may be made some day whose adoption would seem unquestionably beneficial but which could be used only if many or all people were made to avail themselves of it at the same time. <!-- p15.s5 -->

[译文]
甚至可以设想，将来某天会出现一项新发明，其采用看起来毫无疑问是有益的，但只有在许多人甚至所有人同时被迫采用它时才能发挥作用。<!-- p15.s5 -->

[原文]
> Whether such instances are of any great or lasting importance, they are certainly not instances where it could be legitimately claimed that technical progress makes central direction inevitable. <!-- p16.s1 -->

[译文]
无论这些情况有多重要或持久，它们肯定不属于那种能合法声称技术进步使中央管制不可避免的情况。<!-- p16.s1 -->

[原文]
> They would merely make it necessary to choose between gaining a particular advantage by compulsion and not obtaining it—or, in most instances, obtaining it a little later, when further technical advance has overcome the particular difficulties. <!-- p16.s2 -->

[译文]
它们只是要我们在两个选择中做出权衡：通过强制获得特定的好处，或者放弃它，或者在大多数情况下稍晚一些获得它——当进一步的技术进步克服了特定困难之时。<!-- p16.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is true that in such situations we may have to sacrifice a possible immediate gain as the price of our freedom—but we avoid, on the other hand, the necessity of making future developments dependent upon the knowledge which particular people now possess. <!-- p16.s3 -->

[译文]
诚然，在这种情况下，我们可能需要为自由的代价而放弃可能的即时收益——但另一方面，我们避免了将未来发展的可能性局限于某些人目前的知识。<!-- p16.s3 -->

[原文]
> By sacrificing such possible present advantages, we preserve an important stimulus to further progress. <!-- p16.s4 -->

[译文]
通过放弃这些可能的当前优势，我们保留了刺激进一步进步的重要动力。<!-- p16.s4 -->

[原文]
> Though in the short run the price we have to pay for variety and freedom of choice may sometimes be high, in the long run even material progress will depend on this very variety, because we can never predict from which of the many forms in which a good or service can be provided something better may develop. <!-- p16.s5 -->

[译文]
虽然从短期看，我们为多样性和选择自由所付出的代价有时确实很高，但从长期看，即使是物质进步也依赖于这种多样性本身。我们永远无法预测，在提供商品或服务的众多形式中，哪一种会演化出更好的东西。<!-- p16.s5 -->

[原文]
> It cannot, of course, be asserted that the preservation of freedom at the expense of some addition to our present material comfort will be thus rewarded in all instances. But the argument for freedom is precisely that we ought to leave room for the unforeseeable free growth. <!-- p16.s6 -->

[译文]
当然，不能说为了保全自由而牺牲一些当前物质舒适的做法，在所有情况下都会得到这样的回报。但支持自由的论点恰恰是：我们应该为不可预测的自由增长留出空间。<!-- p16.s6 -->

[原文]
> It applies, therefore, no less when, on the basis of our present knowledge, compulsion would seem to bring only advantages, and although in a particular instance it may actually do no harm. <!-- p16.s7 -->

[译文]
因此，即使根据我们目前的知识，强制似乎只会带来好处，即使在某个特定情况下它实际上可能不会造成伤害，这个论点也同样适用。<!-- p16.s7 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> In much of the current discussion on the effects of technological progress this progress is presented to us as if it were something outside us which could compel us to use the new knowledge in a particular way. <!-- p17.s1 -->

[译文]
当今关于技术进步影响的许多讨论中，技术进步被呈现成仿佛是某种外在于我们的力量，足以强迫我们以特定的方式使用新知识。<!-- p17.s1 -->

[原文]
> While it is true, of course, that inventions have given us tremendous power, it is absurd to suggest that we must use this power to destroy our most precious inheritance: liberty. <!-- p17.s2 -->

[译文]
诚然，发明赋予了我们巨大的力量。但暗示我们必须用这种力量来摧毁我们最宝贵的遗产——自由——是荒谬的。<!-- p17.s2 -->

[原文]
> It does mean, however, that if we want to preserve it, we must guard it more jealously than ever and that we must be prepared to make sacrifices for it. <!-- p17.s3 -->

[译文]
这确实意味着，如果我们想保全自由，就必须比以往任何时候都更加坚决地守护它，并准备好为之做出牺牲。<!-- p17.s3 -->

[原文]
> While there is nothing in modern technological developments which forces us toward comprehensive economic planning, there is a great deal in them which makes infinitely more dangerous the power a planning authority would possess. <!-- p17.s4 -->

[译文]
虽然现代技术进步中没有什么东西强迫我们走向全面经济计划，但其中有很多因素使得计划当局若真的获得权力，将变得无限危险。<!-- p17.s4 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> While there can thus be little doubt that the movement toward planning is the result of deliberate action and that there are no external necessities which force us to it, it is worth inquiring why so large a proportion of the technical experts should be found in the front rank of the planners. <!-- p18.s1 -->

[译文]
既然毫无疑问走向计划的运动是刻意选择的结果，而非外部必然性所迫，那么就值得追问：为什么有这么多技术专家会出现在计划主义者的前列呢？<!-- p18.s1 -->

[原文]
> The explanation of this phenomenon is closely connected with an important fact which the critics of the planners should always keep in mind: that there is little question that almost every one of the technical ideals of our experts could be realized within a comparatively short time if to achieve them were made the sole aim of humanity. <!-- p18.s2 -->

[译文]
对这一现象的解释与一个重要事实密切相连——计划主义的批评者应该始终牢记这个事实：几乎毫无疑问，如果实现我们专家的每个技术理想都成为人类的唯一目标，那么几乎所有这些理想都能在相对短的时间内实现。<!-- p18.s2 -->

[原文]
> There is an infinite number of good things, which we all agree are highly desirable as well as possible, but of which we cannot hope to achieve more than a few within our lifetime, or which we can hope to achieve only very imperfectly. <!-- p18.s3 -->

[译文]
存在着无数好的东西，我们都同意它们既可取又可能实现，但我们在有生之年只能希望实现其中很少一部分，也许还只能实现得很不完美。<!-- p18.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is the frustration of his ambitions in his own field which makes the specialist revolt against the existing order. <!-- p18.s4 -->

[译文]
正是这种挫折——专家在自己领域内雄心的挫折——使他反抗现存秩序。<!-- p18.s4 -->

[原文]
> We all find it difficult to bear to see things left undone which everybody must admit are both desirable and possible. That these things cannot all be done at the same time, that any one of them can be achieved only at the sacrifice of others, can be seen only by taking into account factors which fall outside any specialism, which can be appreciated only by a painful intellectual effort—the more painful as it forces us to see against a wider background the objects to which most of our labors are directed and to balance them against others which lie outside our immediate interest and for which, for that reason, we care less. <!-- p18.s5 -->

[译文]
我们都难以接受看到那些公认既可取又可能的事情仍然未被完成。要认识到这些事情不能同时全部完成，任何一件的成就都需要牺牲其他事情，这需要考虑超出任何专业范围的因素，这是一种痛苦的智力努力——痛苦之处在于它迫使我们在更广阔的背景下重新审视我们大部分劳动所指向的目标，并将其与那些超出我们直接利益之外、我们因此不那么关心的目标进行权衡。<!-- p18.s5 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> Every one of the many things which, considered in isolation, it would be possible to achieve in a planned society creates enthusiasts for planning who feel confident that they will be able to instill into the directors of such a society their sense of the value of the particular objective; and the hopes of some of them would undoubtedly be fulfilled, since a planned society would certainly further some objectives more than is the case at present. <!-- p19.s1 -->

[译文]
在计划社会中，孤立地看每一件可能实现的事，都会为计划制造热情鼓手。这些热情者相信自己能够将对特定目标价值的理解灌输给社会的管理者。其中一些人的希望无疑会得到满足，因为计划社会必然会比现在更多地促进某些目标。<!-- p19.s1 -->

[原文]
> It would be foolish to deny that the instances of planned or semiplanned societies which we know do furnish illustrations in point, good things which the people of these countries owe entirely to planning. <!-- p19.s2 -->

[译文]
否认我们所知的计划社会或半计划社会确实产生了一些好的成果、这些成果完全源于计划，这是愚蠢的。<!-- p19.s2 -->

[原文]
> The magnificent motor roads in Germany and Italy are an instance often quoted—even though they do not represent a kind of planning not equally possible in a liberal society. <!-- p19.s3 -->

[译文]
德国和意大利的宏伟高速公路经常被引用为例——尽管在自由社会中同样可以建造这样的公路。<!-- p19.s3 -->

[原文]
> But it is equally foolish to quote such instances of technical excellence in particular fields as evidence of the general superiority of planning. <!-- p19.s4 -->

[译文]
但是，引用这些特定领域的技术成就作为计划总体优越性的证据，同样是愚蠢的。<!-- p19.s4 -->

[原文]
> It would be more correct to say that such extreme technical excellence out of line with general conditions is evidence of a misdirection of resources. <!-- p19.s5 -->

[译文]
更恰当的说法是，这种与整体状况不符的极端技术卓越，本身就是资源误配的证明。<!-- p19.s5 -->

[原文]
> Anyone who has driven along the famous German motor roads and found the amount of traffic on them less than on many a secondary road in England can have little doubt that, so far as peace purposes are concerned, there was little justification for them. <!-- p19.s6 -->

[译文]
任何人只要在德国著名的高速公路上驾驶过，发现其交通量反而少于英国许多次要道路，就会明白：就和平目标而言，这些公路几乎没有正当理由。<!-- p19.s6 -->

[原文]
> Whether it was not a case where the planners decided in favor of "guns" instead of "butter" is another matter.[注-原-8] But by our standards there is little ground for enthusiasm. <!-- p19.s7 -->

[译文]
这是否是计划者选择"大炮"而舍"黄油"的案例，那是另一回事。[注-原-8] 但以我们的标准看，几乎没有什么值得热情洋溢的地方。<!-- p19.s7 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> The illusion of the specialist that in a planned society he would secure more attention to the objectives for which he cares most is a more general phenomenon than the term "specialist" at first suggests. <!-- p20.s1 -->

[译文]
专家的错觉——以为在计划社会中自己所关切的目标会获得更多关注——比这个术语最初的含义更普遍。<!-- p20.s1 -->

[原文]
> In our predilections and interests we are all in some measure specialists. <!-- p20.s2 -->

[译文]
从偏好和兴趣上看，我们其实都在某种程度上是专家。<!-- p20.s2 -->

[原文]
> And we all think that our personal order of values is not merely personal but that in a free discussion among rational people we would convince the others that ours is the right one. <!-- p20.s3 -->

[译文]
我们都认为自己的价值排序不仅仅是个人的看法，在理性人之间的自由讨论中，我们能让他人相信自己的观点才是正确的。<!-- p20.s3 -->

[原文]
> The lover of the countryside who wants above all that its traditional appearance should be preserved and that the blots already made by industry on its fair face should be removed, no less than the health enthusiast who wants all the picturesque but unsanitary old cottages cleared away, or the motorist who wishes the country cut up by big motor roads, the efficiency fanatic who desires the maximum of specialization and mechanization no less than the idealist who for the development of personality wants to preserve as many independent craftsmen as possible, all know that their aim can be fully achieved only by planning—and they all want planning for that reason. <!-- p20.s4 -->

[译文]
热爱乡村风景、希望保留其传统外观并清除工业污迹的人；热情的卫生倡导者、希望推平所有风景虽好但不卫生的老房子的人；驾车者、希望修建大型高速公路的人；效率狂热者、追求最大专业化和机械化的人；以及理想主义者、为了人格发展希望保留尽可能多独立手工业者的人——他们都知道，各自的目标只有通过计划才能完全实现。因此他们都想要计划。<!-- p20.s4 -->

[原文]
> But, of course, the adoption of the social planning for which they clamor can only bring out the concealed conflict between their aims. <!-- p20.s5 -->

[译文]
但是，当然，采纳他们呼吁的那种社会计划只会揭露出他们目标之间隐藏的冲突。<!-- p20.s5 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> The movement for planning owes its present strength largely to the fact that, while planning is in the main still an ambition, it unites almost all the single-minded idealists, all the men and women who have devoted their lives to a single task. <!-- p21.s1 -->

[译文]
计划运动之所以拥有现在的力量，很大程度上是因为：虽然计划主要还是一个抱负，但它团结了几乎所有一心一意的理想主义者——所有把生命奉献给单一事业的男男女女。<!-- p21.s1 -->

[原文]
> The hopes they place in planning, however, are the result not of a comprehensive view of society but rather of a very limited view and often the result of a great exaggeration of the importance of the ends they place foremost. <!-- p21.s2 -->

[译文]
然而，他们对计划寄予的希望，并非源于对社会的全面认识，而是源于非常局限的看法，往往是对他们最重视目标的重要性的极大夸大。<!-- p21.s2 -->

[原文]
> This is not to underrate the great pragmatic value of this type of men in a free society like ours, which makes them the subject of just admiration. <!-- p21.s3 -->

[译文]
这并非要贬低这类人在像我们这样的自由社会中的巨大实用价值——他们确实值得敬佩。<!-- p21.s3 -->

[原文]
> But it would make the very men who are most anxious to plan society the most dangerous if they were allowed to do so—and the most intolerant of the planning of others. <!-- p21.s4 -->

[译文]
但是，这些最渴望计划社会的人，一旦被赋予权力，就会变成最危险的人——同时对他人的计划最不容忍。<!-- p21.s4 -->

[原文]
> From the saintly and single-minded idealist to the fanatic is often but a step. <!-- p21.s5 -->

[译文]
从圣洁而专注的理想主义者到狂热分子，往往仅一步之遥。<!-- p21.s5 -->

[原文]
> Though it is the resentment of the frustrated specialist which gives the demand for planning its strongest impetus, there could hardly be a more unbearable—and more irrational—world than one in which the most eminent specialists in each field were allowed to proceed unchecked with the realization of their ideals. <!-- p21.s6 -->

[译文]
虽然正是受挫专家的怨恨给计划需求提供了最强的推动力，但几乎没有什么世界比这样的世界更难以忍受、更不理性：在这个世界里，每个领域最杰出的专家被任由不受制约地推行其理想。<!-- p21.s6 -->

[原文]
> Nor can "coordination," as some planners seem to imagine, become a new specialism. <!-- p21.s7 -->

[译文]
而且，"协调"——尽管某些计划者这样想——也不能成为一个新的专业。<!-- p21.s7 -->

[原文]
> The economist is the last to claim that he has the knowledge which the coordinator would need. His plea is for a method which effects such coordination without the need for an omniscient dictator. <!-- p21.s8 -->

[译文]
经济学家是最不会声称自己拥有协调者所需知识的人。他所恳求的是一种能够实现协调而无需全知独裁者的方法。<!-- p21.s8 -->

[原文]
> But that means precisely the retention of some such impersonal, and often unintelligible, checks on individual efforts as those against which all specialists chafe. <!-- p21.s9 -->

[译文]
但这恰恰意味着保留某些非人格的、往往令人费解的约束——对个人努力的约束，正是这种约束让所有专家感到不快。<!-- p21.s9 -->

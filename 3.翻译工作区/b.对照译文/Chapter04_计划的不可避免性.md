# 计划的"不可避免性"

> 摘要：本章批驳"技术进步使计划不可避免"的论调，揭示垄断与计划的兴起源于刻意的政策而非客观必然，并论证竞争机制在复杂经济中的不可替代性。

## 第一节：技术进步与计划需求的谬误

[原文]
> It is a revealing fact that few planners are content to say that central planning is desirable. Most of them affirm that we can no longer choose but are compelled by circumstances beyond our control to substitute planning for competition. <!-- p1.s1 -->

[译文]
一个很能说明问题的事实是：很少有计划者满足于说中央计划是可取的。他们中的大多数人断言，我们已经无法选择，而是被超出我们控制的环境所迫，不得不用计划取代竞争。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> The myth is deliberately cultivated that we are embarking on the new course not out of free will but because competition is spontaneously eliminated by technological changes which we neither can reverse nor should wish to prevent. This argument is rarely developed at any length—it is one of the assertions taken over by one writer from another until, by mere iteration, it has come to be accepted as an established fact. It is, nevertheless, devoid of foundation. <!-- p1.s2 -->

[译文]
人们刻意培育这样一个神话：我们之所以走上这条新道路，并非出于自由意志，而是因为竞争正被技术变革自发地淘汰——而这些技术变革，我们既无力扭转，也不应试图阻止。这个论证很少得到详尽展开——它不过是一个被作家们相互转述的断言，仅仅通过反复重复，就被当作既定事实接受了。然而，它毫无根据。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> The tendency toward monopoly and planning is not the result of any "objective facts" beyond our control but the product of opinions fostered and propagated for half a century until they have come to dominate all our policy. <!-- p1.s3 -->

[译文]
垄断和计划的趋势，并非源于任何超出我们控制的"客观事实"，而是半个世纪以来被培育和传播的观念的产物——这些观念最终主导了我们所有的政策。<!-- p1.s3 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> Of the various arguments employed to demonstrate the inevitability of planning, the one most frequently heard is that technological changes have made competition impossible in a constantly increasing number of fields and that the only choice left to us is between control of production by private monopolies and direction by the government. <!-- p2.s1 -->

[译文]
在用来论证计划不可避免性的各种论据中，最常听到的一个是：技术变革已经使竞争在越来越多的领域变得不可能，而留给我们的唯一选择，就是在私人垄断对生产的控制与政府的指导之间做出抉择。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> This belief derives mainly from the Marxist doctrine of the "concentration of industry," although, like so many Marxist ideas, it is now found in many circles which have received it at third or fourth hand and do not know whence it derives. <!-- p2.s2 -->

[译文]
这种信念主要源自马克思主义关于"产业集中"的学说。不过，就像许多马克思主义观念一样，它现在流行于许多圈子，这些圈子是三手四手接受了这种观念，根本不知道它从何而来。<!-- p2.s2 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> The historical fact of the progressive growth of monopoly during the last fifty years and the increasing restriction of the field in which competition rules is, of course, not disputed—although the extent of the phenomenon is often greatly exaggerated.[注-原-2] <!-- p3.s1 -->

[译文]
过去五十年间垄断逐步增长、竞争领域日益缩小，这一历史事实当然无可争辩——尽管这种现象的程度常常被大大夸大了。[注-原-2] <!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> The important question is whether this development is a necessary consequence of the advance of technology or whether it is simply the result of the policies pursued in most countries. We shall presently see that the actual history of this development strongly suggests the latter. But we must first consider in how far modern technological developments are of such a kind as to make the growth of monopolies in wide fields inevitable. <!-- p3.s2 -->

[译文]
重要的问题是：这种发展究竟是技术进步的必然结果，还是仅仅是大多数国家所采取政策的产物？我们很快就会看到，这一发展的实际历史强烈地表明是后者。但我们必须首先考察，现代技术发展在多大程度上属于那种会使垄断在广泛领域不可避免地增长的类型。<!-- p3.s2 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> The alleged technological cause of the growth of monopoly is the superiority of the large firm over the small, owing to the greater efficiency of modern methods of mass production. <!-- p4.s1 -->

[译文]
所谓的垄断增长的技术原因，是大企业相对于小企业的优越性——这种优越性据称源于现代大规模生产方法的更高效率。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> Modern methods, it is asserted, have created conditions in the majority of industries where the production of the large firm can be increased at decreasing costs per unit, with the result that the large firms are everywhere underbidding and driving out the small ones; this process must go on until in each industry only one or at most a few giant firms are left. <!-- p4.s2 -->

[译文]
有人断言，现代方法在大多数产业中创造了这样的条件：大企业的生产可以以递减的单位成本增加，结果是大企业到处以更低价格竞标，将小企业挤出市场。这一过程必然持续下去，直到每个产业只剩下一家或至多几家巨型企业。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> This argument singles out one effect sometimes accompanying technological progress; it disregards others which work in the opposite direction; and it receives little support from a serious study of the facts. <!-- p4.s3 -->

[译文]
这个论证挑出了有时伴随技术进步的一种效应，却忽视了其他朝相反方向作用的效应。对事实的严肃研究几乎不支持这个论证。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> We cannot here investigate this question in detail and must be content to accept the best evidence available. <!-- p4.s4 -->

[译文]
我们在这里无法详细考察这个问题，只能满足于接受现有的最佳证据。<!-- p4.s4 -->

[原文]
> The most comprehensive study of the facts undertaken in recent times is that by the Temporary National Economic Committee on the Concentration of Economic Power. The final report of this committee (which certainly cannot be accused of an undue liberal bias) arrives at the conclusion that the view according to which the greater efficiency of large-scale production is the cause of the disappearance of competition "finds scant support in any evidence that is now at hand."[注-原-3] <!-- p4.s5 -->

[译文]
近年来对事实进行的最全面研究，是临时全国经济委员会关于经济权力集中的研究。该委员会的最终报告（这个委员会肯定不会被指责有过度的自由主义偏见）得出结论：认为大规模生产的更高效率是竞争消失原因的观点，"在目前掌握的任何证据中几乎得不到支持"。[注-原-3] <!-- p4.s5 -->

[原文]
> And the detailed monograph on the question which was prepared for the committee sums up the answer in this statement: <!-- p4.s6 -->

[译文]
为该委员会准备的关于这个问题的详细专题著作，在这段陈述中总结了答案：<!-- p4.s6 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> "The superior efficiency of large establishments has not been demonstrated; the advantages that are supposed to destroy competition have failed to manifest themselves in many fields. Nor do the economies of size, where they exist, invariably necessitate monopoly. . . . The size or the sizes of the optimum efficiency may be reached long before the major part of a supply is subjected to such control. The conclusions that the advantage of large-scale production must lead inevitably to the abolition of competition cannot be accepted. It should be noted, moreover, that monopoly is frequently the product of factors other than the lower costs of greater size. It is attained through collusive agreement and promoted by public policies. When these agreements are invalidated and when these policies are reversed, competitive conditions can be restored."[注-原-4] <!-- p5.s1 -->

[译文]
"大型企业的优越效率尚未得到证明；那些被认为会摧毁竞争的优势，在许多领域未能显现。即便在规模经济确实存在的地方，它们也并非必然导致垄断……在供应的大部分受到这种控制之前很久，最优效率的规模或各种规模就可能达到。大规模生产的优势必然导致竞争废除的结论，是不能被接受的。而且应当注意，垄断往往是较大规模带来的较低成本以外的其他因素的产物。垄断是通过串通协议达成的，并由公共政策推动。当这些协议被宣告无效、当这些政策被逆转时，竞争条件就能恢复。"[注-原-4] <!-- p5.s1 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> An investigation of conditions in England would lead to very similar results. Anyone who has observed how aspiring monopolists regularly seek and frequently obtain the assistance of the power of the state to make their control effective can have little doubt that there is nothing inevitable about this development. <!-- p6.s1 -->

[译文]
对英国情况的调查会得出非常相似的结果。任何观察过有志成为垄断者的人如何经常寻求并频繁获得国家权力的协助，以使其控制生效的人，都不会对这一发展的非必然性有什么怀疑。<!-- p6.s1 -->

&nbsp;

## 第二节：垄断问题的根源

[原文]
> This conclusion is strongly supported by the historical order in which the decline of competition and the growth of monopoly manifested themselves in different countries. <!-- p7.s1 -->

[译文]
竞争衰落和垄断增长在不同国家表现出来的历史顺序，有力地支持了这个结论。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> If they were the result of technological developments or a necessary product of the evolution of "capitalism," we should expect them to appear first in the countries with the most advanced economic system. In fact, they appeared first during the last third of the nineteenth century in what were then comparatively young industrial countries, the United States and Germany. <!-- p7.s2 -->

[译文]
如果它们是技术发展的结果，或者是"资本主义"演化的必然产物，我们应当预期它们首先出现在经济制度最先进的国家。实际上，它们最先出现在十九世纪最后三十年的当时相对年轻的工业国家——美国和德国。<!-- p7.s2 -->

[原文]
> In the latter country especially, which came to be regarded as the model country typifying the necessary evolution of capitalism, the growth of cartels and syndicates has since 1878 been systematically fostered by deliberate policy. Not only the instrument of protection but direct inducements and ultimately compulsion were used by the governments to further the creation of monopolies for the regulation of prices and sales. <!-- p7.s3 -->

[译文]
尤其是在后一个国家——它后来被视为典型体现资本主义必然演化的模范国家——自1878年以来，卡特尔和辛迪加的增长就系统地受到刻意政策的扶持。政府不仅使用保护手段，还使用直接诱导，最终使用强制手段，来促进垄断组织的建立，以调节价格和销售。<!-- p7.s3 -->

[原文]
> It was here that, with the help of the state, the first great experiment in "scientific planning" and "conscious organization of industry" led to the creation of giant monopolies, which were represented as inevitable growths fifty years before the same was done in Great Britain. <!-- p7.s4 -->

[译文]
正是在这里，在国家的帮助下，"科学计划"和"有意识的产业组织"的首次伟大实验导致了巨型垄断组织的诞生。这些垄断组织被描述为不可避免的增长——这比英国进行同样的事情早了五十年。<!-- p7.s4 -->

[原文]
> It is largely due to the influence of German socialist theoreticians, particularly Sombart, generalizing from the experience of their country, that the inevitable development of the competitive system into "monopoly capitalism" became widely accepted.[注-原-5] <!-- p7.s5 -->

[译文]
正是主要由于德国社会主义理论家——特别是桑巴特——从他们国家的经验中进行概括的影响，竞争制度向"垄断资本主义"的不可避免发展才被广泛接受。[注-原-5] <!-- p7.s5 -->

[原文]
> That in the United States a highly protectionist policy made a somewhat similar development possible seemed to confirm this generalization. The development of Germany, however, more than that of the United States, came to be regarded as representative of a universal tendency; and it became a commonplace to speak—to quote a widely read political essay of recent date—of "Germany where all the social and political forces of modern civilization have reached their most advanced form."[注-原-6] <!-- p7.s6 -->

[译文]
美国高度保护主义的政策使得某种类似的发展成为可能，这似乎证实了这种概括。然而，德国的发展，比美国的发展更被视为代表一种普遍趋势。用一篇近期广为流传的政治论文的话来说，谈论"德国，在那里现代文明的所有社会和政治力量都达到了最先进的形式"，成了老生常谈。[注-原-6] <!-- p7.s6 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> How little there was of inevitability in all this, and how much is the result of deliberate policy, becomes clear when we consider the position in England until 1931 and the development since that year in which Great Britain also embarked upon a policy of general protection.[注-原-7] <!-- p8.s1 -->

[译文]
当我们考察英国直到1931年的状况，以及自该年英国也开始实行普遍保护政策以来的发展时，就会清楚地看到：这一切有多么少的必然性，又有多少是刻意政策的结果。[注-原-7] <!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is only a dozen years since, except for a few industries which had obtained protection earlier, British industry was on the whole as competitive as, perhaps, at any time in its history. <!-- p8.s2 -->

[译文]
仅仅十几年前，除了少数早先获得保护的产业外，英国产业整体上的竞争性之强，可能堪比其历史上的任何时期。<!-- p8.s2 -->

[原文]
> And, although during the 1920s it suffered severely from incompatible policies followed with regard to wages and to money, at least the years up to 1929 compare with regard to employment and general activity not unfavorably with the 1930s. <!-- p8.s3 -->

[译文]
尽管在1920年代，英国因工资和货币方面采取的不兼容政策而遭受严重损失，但至少1929年之前的那些年份，在就业和总体活动方面与1930年代相比并不逊色。<!-- p8.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is only since the transition to protection and the general change in British economic policy accompanying it that the growth of monopolies has proceeded at an amazing rate and has transformed British industry to an extent the public has scarcely yet realized. <!-- p8.s4 -->

[译文]
只是自从转向保护主义以及随之而来的英国经济政策的全面改变以来，垄断的增长才以惊人的速度进行，并将英国产业改造到公众几乎尚未意识到的程度。<!-- p8.s4 -->

[原文]
> To argue that this development has anything to do with the technological progress during this period, that technological necessities which in Germany operated in the 1880s and 1890s, made themselves felt here in the 1930s, is not much less absurd than the claim, implied in a statement of Mussolini, that Italy had to abolish individual freedom before other European people because its civilization had marched so far in advance of the rest! <!-- p8.s5 -->

[译文]
要论证这一发展与这一时期的技术进步有任何关系，论证在德国于1880和1890年代起作用的技术必然性在这里于1930年代显现，这几乎与墨索里尼的一项声明中暗含的主张一样荒谬——那个主张是：意大利不得不在其他欧洲民族之前废除个人自由，因为它的文明领先于其他民族太多了！<!-- p8.s5 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> In so far as England is concerned, the thesis that the change in opinion and policy merely follows an inexorable change in the facts can be given a certain appearance of truth, just because the nation has followed at a distance the intellectual developments elsewhere. <!-- p9.s1 -->

[译文]
就英国而言，观念和政策的变化仅仅是跟随事实的不可逆转变化这一论点，可以被赋予某种真实的表象——恰恰因为这个国家在一定距离上跟随了其他地方的思想发展。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> It could thus be argued that monopolistic organization of industry grew up in spite of the fact that public opinion still favored competition but that outside events frustrated their wishes. <!-- p9.s2 -->

[译文]
因此可以论证，尽管公众舆论仍然支持竞争，产业的垄断组织还是发展起来了，但外部事件挫败了他们的愿望。<!-- p9.s2 -->

[原文]
> The true relation between theory and practice becomes, however, clear as soon as we look to the prototype of this development—Germany. <!-- p9.s3 -->

[译文]
然而，理论与实践之间的真实关系，一旦我们观察这一发展的原型——德国——就会变得清晰。<!-- p9.s3 -->

[原文]
> That there the suppression of competition was a matter of deliberate policy, that it was undertaken in the service of the ideal which we now call planning, there can be no doubt. <!-- p9.s4 -->

[译文]
在那里，压制竞争是刻意政策的问题，是为了服务于我们现在称之为计划的理想而进行的——这一点毫无疑问。<!-- p9.s4 -->

[原文]
> In the progressive advance toward a completely planned society the Germans, and all the people who are imitating their example, are merely following the course which nineteenth-century thinkers, particularly Germans, have mapped out for them. <!-- p9.s5 -->

[译文]
在朝着完全计划社会的渐进推进中，德国人以及所有模仿他们榜样的人，仅仅是在遵循十九世纪思想家——特别是德国思想家——为他们规划的道路。<!-- p9.s5 -->

[原文]
> The intellectual history of the last sixty or eighty years is indeed a perfect illustration of the truth that in social evolution nothing is inevitable but thinking makes it so. <!-- p9.s6 -->

[译文]
过去六七十年的思想史，确实完美地说明了这样一个真理：在社会演化中，没有什么是不可避免的，唯有思想使之如此。<!-- p9.s6 -->

&nbsp;

## 第三节：竞争的可能性与条件

[原文]
> The assertion that modern technological progress makes planning inevitable can also be interpreted in a different manner. It may mean that the complexity of our modern industrial civilization creates new problems with which we cannot hope to deal effectively except by central planning. <!-- p10.s1 -->

[译文]
现代技术进步使计划不可避免的断言，也可以用另一种方式来解释。它可能意味着，现代工业文明的复杂性创造了新问题，除非通过中央计划，我们无法指望有效地处理这些问题。<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> In a sense this is true—yet not in the wide sense in which it is claimed. <!-- p10.s2 -->

[译文]
从某种意义上说这是对的——但并非在被主张的那种广泛意义上。<!-- p10.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is, for example, a commonplace that many of the problems created by a modern town, like many other problems caused by close contiguity in space, are not adequately solved by competition. But it is not these problems, like those of the "public utilities," etc., which are uppermost in the minds of those who invoke the complexity of modern civilization as an argument for central planning. <!-- p10.s3 -->

[译文]
例如，现代城市造成的许多问题，就像空间上的密切邻接造成的许多其他问题一样，不能由竞争充分解决——这是常识。但是，那些援引现代文明的复杂性作为中央计划论据的人，心中最关注的并非诸如"公用事业"等这类问题。<!-- p10.s3 -->

[原文]
> What they generally suggest is that the increasing difficulty of obtaining a coherent picture of the complete economic process makes it indispensable that things should be coordinated by some central agency if social life is not to dissolve in chaos. <!-- p10.s4 -->

[译文]
他们通常暗示的是：要获得完整经济过程的连贯图景越来越困难，这使得如果社会生活不要陷入混乱，就必须由某个中央机构来协调事务。<!-- p10.s4 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> This argument is based on a complete misapprehension of the working of competition. <!-- p11.s1 -->

[译文]
这个论证基于对竞争运作的完全误解。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> Far from being appropriate only to comparatively simple conditions, it is the very complexity of the division of labor under modern conditions which makes competition the only method by which such coordination can be adequately brought about. <!-- p11.s2 -->

[译文]
竞争远非只适用于相对简单的条件。恰恰是现代条件下分工的复杂性，使得竞争成为能够充分实现这种协调的唯一方法。<!-- p11.s2 -->

[原文]
> There would be no difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant facts. <!-- p11.s3 -->

[译文]
如果条件简单到一个人或一个委员会能够有效审视所有相关事实，那么有效的控制或计划就不会有什么困难。<!-- p11.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them that decentralization becomes imperative. <!-- p11.s4 -->

[译文]
只有当必须考虑的因素变得如此之多，以至于不可能获得它们的全貌时，分权才变得势在必行。<!-- p11.s4 -->

[原文]
> But, once decentralization is necessary, the problem of coordination arises—a coordination which leaves the separate agencies free to adjust their activities to the facts which only they can know and yet brings about a mutual adjustment of their respective plans. <!-- p11.s5 -->

[译文]
但是，一旦分权成为必要，协调问题就出现了——这种协调既要让各个独立机构自由地根据只有它们才能知道的事实调整其活动，又要实现它们各自计划的相互调整。<!-- p11.s5 -->

[原文]
> As decentralization has become necessary because nobody can consciously balance all the considerations bearing on the decisions of so many individuals, the coordination can clearly be effected not by "conscious control" but only by arrangements which convey to each agent the information he must possess in order effectively to adjust his decisions to those of others. <!-- p11.s6 -->

[译文]
既然分权之所以成为必要，是因为没有人能够有意识地权衡关系到如此多个人决策的所有考虑因素，那么协调显然不能通过"有意识的控制"来实现，而只能通过这样的安排来实现：将每个行动者为有效调整其决策以适应他人决策而必须拥有的信息传递给他。<!-- p11.s6 -->

[原文]
> And because all the details of the changes constantly affecting the conditions of demand and supply of the different commodities can never be fully known, or quickly enough be collected and disseminated, by any one center, what is required is some apparatus of registration which automatically records all the relevant effects of individual actions and whose indications are at the same time the resultant of, and the guide for, all the individual decisions. <!-- p11.s7 -->

[译文]
而且，由于不断影响不同商品供求条件的变化的所有细节，永远无法被任何一个中心完全知晓，或足够迅速地收集和传播，因此所需要的是某种登记装置，它能自动记录个人行动的所有相关影响，其指示既是所有个人决策的结果，又是对所有个人决策的指引。<!-- p11.s7 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> This is precisely what the price system does under competition, and which no other system even promises to accomplish. <!-- p12.s1 -->

[译文]
这正是价格体系在竞争下所做的事情，而没有其他体系甚至承诺能做到这一点。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> It enables entrepreneurs, by watching the movement of comparatively few prices, as an engineer watches the hands of a few dials, to adjust their activities to those of their fellows. <!-- p12.s2 -->

[译文]
它使企业家能够通过观察相对较少的价格变动——就像工程师观察几个表盘的指针一样——将他们的活动调整为与其他人的活动相适应。<!-- p12.s2 -->

[原文]
> The important point here is that the price system will fulfill this function only if competition prevails, that is, if the individual producer has to adapt himself to price changes and cannot control them. <!-- p12.s3 -->

[译文]
这里的要点是，价格体系只有在竞争盛行时才能履行这一功能，也就是说，只有当个别生产者必须适应价格变化而不能控制价格时。<!-- p12.s3 -->

[原文]
> The more complicated the whole, the more dependent we become on that division of knowledge between individuals whose separate efforts are coordinated by the impersonal mechanism for transmitting the relevant information known by us as the price system. <!-- p12.s4 -->

[译文]
整体越复杂，我们就越依赖于个人之间的知识分工——这些个人的各自努力通过我们所知的传递相关信息的非人格机制即价格体系来协调。<!-- p12.s4 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> It is no exaggeration to say that if we had had to rely on conscious central planning for the growth of our industrial system, it would never have reached the degree of differentiation, complexity, and flexibility it has attained. <!-- p13.s1 -->

[译文]
毫不夸张地说，如果我们不得不依靠有意识的中央计划来实现我们工业体系的增长，它永远不会达到现在所达到的分化、复杂性和灵活性程度。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> Compared with this method of solving the economic problem by means of decentralization plus automatic coordination, the more obvious method of central direction is incredibly clumsy, primitive, and limited in scope. <!-- p13.s2 -->

[译文]
与这种通过分权加自动协调来解决经济问题的方法相比，更显而易见的中央指导方法，是令人难以置信地笨拙、原始和范围有限的。<!-- p13.s2 -->

[原文]
> That the division of labor has reached the extent which makes modern civilization possible we owe to the fact that it did not have to be consciously created but that man tumbled on a method by which the division of labor could be extended far beyond the limits within which it could have been planned. <!-- p13.s3 -->

[译文]
分工之所以达到使现代文明成为可能的程度，我们要归功于这样一个事实：它不必被有意识地创造，而是人类偶然发现了一种方法，通过这种方法，分工可以扩展到远远超出它本可以被计划的限度。<!-- p13.s3 -->

[原文]
> Any further growth of its complexity, therefore, far from making central direction more necessary, makes it more important than ever that we should use a technique which does not depend on conscious control. <!-- p13.s4 -->

[译文]
因此，其复杂性的任何进一步增长，非但不会使中央指导变得更加必要，反而使我们使用一种不依赖于有意识控制的技术变得比以往任何时候都更重要。<!-- p13.s4 -->

&nbsp;

## 第四节：计划的真正动机

[原文]
> There is yet another theory which connects the growth of monopolies with technological progress, and which uses arguments almost opposite to those we have just considered; though not often clearly stated, it has also exercised considerable influence. <!-- p14.s1 -->

[译文]
还有另一种理论将垄断的增长与技术进步联系起来，它使用的论据几乎与我们刚才考虑的相反。尽管这一理论不常被清晰表述，但它也产生了相当大的影响。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> It contends not that modern technique destroys competition but that, on the contrary, it will be impossible to make use of many of the new technological possibilities unless protection against competition is granted, i.e., a monopoly is conferred. <!-- p14.s2 -->

[译文]
它主张的不是现代技术摧毁竞争，而是相反：除非授予免受竞争的保护（即授予垄断地位），否则将不可能利用许多新技术可能性。<!-- p14.s2 -->

[原文]
> This type of argument is not necessarily fraudulent, as the critical reader will perhaps suspect: the obvious answer—that if a new technique for satisfying our wants is really better, it ought to be able to stand up against all competition—does not dispose of all instances to which this argument refers. <!-- p14.s3 -->

[译文]
这类论证未必是欺诈性的，尽管批判性的读者可能会这样怀疑：显而易见的回答——如果一种满足我们需要的新技术确实更好，它应该能够经受住所有竞争——并不能处理这个论证所涉及的所有情况。<!-- p14.s3 -->

[原文]
> No doubt in many cases it is used merely as a form of special pleading by interested parties. Even more often it is probably based on a confusion between technical excellence from a narrow engineering point of view and desirability from the point of view of society as a whole. <!-- p14.s4 -->

[译文]
毫无疑问，在许多情况下，它仅仅被利益相关方用作一种特殊辩护的形式。更常见的情况可能是，它基于狭隘工程观点的技术卓越性与整个社会观点的可取性之间的混淆。<!-- p14.s4 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> There remains, however, a group of instances where the argument has some force. <!-- p15.s1 -->

[译文]
然而，仍然有一些情况，这个论证具有一定的力量。<!-- p15.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is, for example, at least conceivable that the British automobile industry might be able to supply a car cheaper and better than cars used to be in the United States if everyone in England were made to use the same kind of car or that the use of electricity for all purposes could be made cheaper than coal or gas if everybody could be made to use only electricity. <!-- p15.s2 -->

[译文]
例如，至少可以设想，如果英国的每个人都被强制使用同一种汽车，英国汽车工业可能能够提供比美国过去使用的汽车更便宜更好的汽车；或者，如果每个人都被强制只使用电力，那么电力用于所有目的可能比煤或煤气更便宜。<!-- p15.s2 -->

[原文]
> In instances like these it is at least possible that we might all be better off and should prefer the new situation if we had the choice—but that no individual ever gets the choice, because the alternative is either that we should all use the same cheap car (or all should use only electricity) or that we should have the choice between these things with each of them at a much higher price. <!-- p15.s3 -->

[译文]
在这样的情况中，至少有可能我们都会过得更好，如果我们有选择的话，我们应该更喜欢新情况——但没有个人能得到这种选择，因为可选择的要么是我们都使用同样的廉价汽车（或都只使用电力），要么是我们在这些东西之间有选择，但每样东西的价格都高得多。<!-- p15.s3 -->

[原文]
> I do not know whether this is true in either of the instances given. But it must be admitted that it is possible that, by compulsory standardization or the prohibition of variety beyond a certain degree, abundance might be increased in some fields more than sufficiently to compensate for the restriction of the choice of the consumer. <!-- p15.s4 -->

[译文]
我不知道所给的任何一个例子中这是否属实。但必须承认，通过强制标准化或禁止超过一定程度的多样性，在某些领域的丰富程度可能增加到足以补偿消费者选择受限的程度。<!-- p15.s4 -->

[原文]
> It is even conceivable that a new invention may be made some day whose adoption would seem unquestionably beneficial but which could be used only if many or all people were made to avail themselves of it at the same time. <!-- p15.s5 -->

[译文]
甚至可以设想，将来某天可能出现一项新发明，其采用看起来毫无疑问是有益的，但只有在许多人或所有人同时被迫使用它时才能使用。<!-- p15.s5 -->

[原文]
> Whether such instances are of any great or lasting importance, they are certainly not instances where it could be legitimately claimed that technical progress makes central direction inevitable. <!-- p16.s1 -->

[译文]
无论这些情况是否具有重大或持久的重要性，它们肯定不是可以合法声称技术进步使中央指导不可避免的情况。<!-- p16.s1 -->

[原文]
> They would merely make it necessary to choose between gaining a particular advantage by compulsion and not obtaining it—or, in most instances, obtaining it a little later, when further technical advance has overcome the particular difficulties. <!-- p16.s2 -->

[译文]
它们只是使得有必要在通过强制获得特定优势与不获得它之间作出选择——或者在大多数情况下，稍晚一些获得它，当进一步的技术进步克服了特定困难时。<!-- p16.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is true that in such situations we may have to sacrifice a possible immediate gain as the price of our freedom—but we avoid, on the other hand, the necessity of making future developments dependent upon the knowledge which particular people now possess. <!-- p16.s3 -->

[译文]
的确，在这种情况下，我们可能不得不牺牲可能的即时收益作为自由的代价——但另一方面，我们避免了使未来发展依赖于特定人现在拥有的知识的必要性。<!-- p16.s3 -->

[原文]
> By sacrificing such possible present advantages, we preserve an important stimulus to further progress. <!-- p16.s4 -->

[译文]
通过牺牲这样可能的当前优势，我们保留了进一步进步的重要刺激。<!-- p16.s4 -->

[原文]
> Though in the short run the price we have to pay for variety and freedom of choice may sometimes be high, in the long run even material progress will depend on this very variety, because we can never predict from which of the many forms in which a good or service can be provided something better may develop. <!-- p16.s5 -->

[译文]
尽管在短期内，我们为多样性和选择自由必须支付的代价有时可能很高，但从长远来看，即使是物质进步也将依赖于这种多样性本身，因为我们永远无法预测从提供商品或服务的众多形式中的哪一种可能发展出更好的东西。<!-- p16.s5 -->

[原文]
> It cannot, of course, be asserted that the preservation of freedom at the expense of some addition to our present material comfort will be thus rewarded in all instances. But the argument for freedom is precisely that we ought to leave room for the unforeseeable free growth. <!-- p16.s6 -->

[译文]
当然，不能断言以牺牲我们目前物质舒适的某些增加来保全自由，在所有情况下都会得到这样的回报。但支持自由的论证恰恰是：我们应该为不可预见的自由增长留出空间。<!-- p16.s6 -->

[原文]
> It applies, therefore, no less when, on the basis of our present knowledge, compulsion would seem to bring only advantages, and although in a particular instance it may actually do no harm. <!-- p16.s7 -->

[译文]
因此，即使根据我们目前的知识，强制似乎只会带来好处，而且在特定情况下它实际上可能不会造成伤害，这个论证也同样适用。<!-- p16.s7 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> In much of the current discussion on the effects of technological progress this progress is presented to us as if it were something outside us which could compel us to use the new knowledge in a particular way. <!-- p17.s1 -->

[译文]
在当前关于技术进步影响的许多讨论中，这种进步被呈现给我们，仿佛它是我们之外的某种东西，可以强迫我们以特定方式使用新知识。<!-- p17.s1 -->

[原文]
> While it is true, of course, that inventions have given us tremendous power, it is absurd to suggest that we must use this power to destroy our most precious inheritance: liberty. <!-- p17.s2 -->

[译文]
当然，发明确实给了我们巨大的力量，但暗示我们必须使用这种力量来摧毁我们最宝贵的遗产——自由——则是荒谬的。<!-- p17.s2 -->

[原文]
> It does mean, however, that if we want to preserve it, we must guard it more jealously than ever and that we must be prepared to make sacrifices for it. <!-- p17.s3 -->

[译文]
然而，这确实意味着，如果我们想保全自由，我们必须比以往任何时候都更加小心地守护它，并且必须准备为它做出牺牲。<!-- p17.s3 -->

[原文]
> While there is nothing in modern technological developments which forces us toward comprehensive economic planning, there is a great deal in them which makes infinitely more dangerous the power a planning authority would possess. <!-- p17.s4 -->

[译文]
虽然现代技术发展中没有什么东西迫使我们走向全面的经济计划，但其中有很多东西使计划当局将拥有的权力变得无限更加危险。<!-- p17.s4 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> While there can thus be little doubt that the movement toward planning is the result of deliberate action and that there are no external necessities which force us to it, it is worth inquiring why so large a proportion of the technical experts should be found in the front rank of the planners. <!-- p18.s1 -->

[译文]
因此，尽管毫无疑问，走向计划的运动是刻意行动的结果，并且没有外部必然性迫使我们这样做，但值得探究的是，为什么如此大比例的技术专家会出现在计划者的前列。<!-- p18.s1 -->

[原文]
> The explanation of this phenomenon is closely connected with an important fact which the critics of the planners should always keep in mind: that there is little question that almost every one of the technical ideals of our experts could be realized within a comparatively short time if to achieve them were made the sole aim of humanity. <!-- p18.s2 -->

[译文]
对这一现象的解释与一个重要事实密切相关，计划者的批评者应该始终牢记这个事实：几乎毫无疑问，我们专家的几乎每一个技术理想，如果实现它们被定为人类的唯一目标，都可以在相对较短的时间内实现。<!-- p18.s2 -->

[原文]
> There is an infinite number of good things, which we all agree are highly desirable as well as possible, but of which we cannot hope to achieve more than a few within our lifetime, or which we can hope to achieve only very imperfectly. <!-- p18.s3 -->

[译文]
有无数好东西，我们都同意它们既非常可取又可能实现，但我们在有生之年只能希望实现其中的少数几个，或者只能希望非常不完美地实现它们。<!-- p18.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is the frustration of his ambitions in his own field which makes the specialist revolt against the existing order. <!-- p18.s4 -->

[译文]
正是其所在领域的雄心受挫，使专家反抗现存秩序。<!-- p18.s4 -->

[原文]
> We all find it difficult to bear to see things left undone which everybody must admit are both desirable and possible. That these things cannot all be done at the same time, that any one of them can be achieved only at the sacrifice of others, can be seen only by taking into account factors which fall outside any specialism, which can be appreciated only by a painful intellectual effort—the more painful as it forces us to see against a wider background the objects to which most of our labors are directed and to balance them against others which lie outside our immediate interest and for which, for that reason, we care less. <!-- p18.s5 -->

[译文]
我们都难以忍受看到那些人人必须承认既可取又可能的事情未被完成。这些事情不能同时全部完成，其中任何一个的实现只能以牺牲其他事情为代价——这一点只有考虑到任何专业领域之外的因素才能看到，只有通过痛苦的智力努力才能理解——这种努力越是痛苦，因为它迫使我们在更广阔的背景下看待我们大部分劳动所指向的目标，并将它们与处于我们直接兴趣之外的其他目标相权衡，而正因为如此，我们对后者的关心较少。<!-- p18.s5 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> Every one of the many things which, considered in isolation, it would be possible to achieve in a planned society creates enthusiasts for planning who feel confident that they will be able to instill into the directors of such a society their sense of the value of the particular objective; and the hopes of some of them would undoubtedly be fulfilled, since a planned society would certainly further some objectives more than is the case at present. <!-- p19.s1 -->

[译文]
在计划社会中，孤立地考虑时可能实现的许多事情中的每一件，都会为计划创造热情者，他们确信自己能够向这样一个社会的管理者灌输他们对特定目标价值的感知；他们中一些人的希望无疑会得到满足，因为计划社会肯定会比目前更多地促进某些目标。<!-- p19.s1 -->

[原文]
> It would be foolish to deny that the instances of planned or semiplanned societies which we know do furnish illustrations in point, good things which the people of these countries owe entirely to planning. <!-- p19.s2 -->

[译文]
否认我们所知的计划社会或半计划社会的实例确实提供了恰当的例证——这些国家的人民完全归功于计划的好事情——是愚蠢的。<!-- p19.s2 -->

[原文]
> The magnificent motor roads in Germany and Italy are an instance often quoted—even though they do not represent a kind of planning not equally possible in a liberal society. <!-- p19.s3 -->

[译文]
德国和意大利的宏伟高速公路是常被引用的例子——尽管它们并不代表一种在自由社会中同样不可能实现的计划类型。<!-- p19.s3 -->

[原文]
> But it is equally foolish to quote such instances of technical excellence in particular fields as evidence of the general superiority of planning. <!-- p19.s4 -->

[译文]
但是，引用这些特定领域技术卓越的例子作为计划总体优越性的证据，同样是愚蠢的。<!-- p19.s4 -->

[原文]
> It would be more correct to say that such extreme technical excellence out of line with general conditions is evidence of a misdirection of resources. <!-- p19.s5 -->

[译文]
更正确的说法是，这种与总体条件不符的极端技术卓越，是资源误配的证据。<!-- p19.s5 -->

[原文]
> Anyone who has driven along the famous German motor roads and found the amount of traffic on them less than on many a secondary road in England can have little doubt that, so far as peace purposes are concerned, there was little justification for them. <!-- p19.s6 -->

[译文]
任何曾沿着著名的德国高速公路行驶并发现其交通量少于英国许多次要道路的人，都不会怀疑就和平目的而言，这些公路几乎没有正当理由。<!-- p19.s6 -->

[原文]
> Whether it was not a case where the planners decided in favor of "guns" instead of "butter" is another matter.[注-原-8] But by our standards there is little ground for enthusiasm. <!-- p19.s7 -->

[译文]
这是否是一个计划者决定选择"大炮"而不是"黄油"的案例，是另一回事。[注-原-8] 但按照我们的标准，几乎没有热情的理由。<!-- p19.s7 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> The illusion of the specialist that in a planned society he would secure more attention to the objectives for which he cares most is a more general phenomenon than the term "specialist" at first suggests. <!-- p20.s1 -->

[译文]
专家的幻觉——认为在计划社会中他会为自己最关心的目标获得更多关注——是一种比"专家"这个词最初暗示的更普遍的现象。<!-- p20.s1 -->

[原文]
> In our predilections and interests we are all in some measure specialists. <!-- p20.s2 -->

[译文]
在我们的偏好和兴趣方面，我们在某种程度上都是专家。<!-- p20.s2 -->

[原文]
> And we all think that our personal order of values is not merely personal but that in a free discussion among rational people we would convince the others that ours is the right one. <!-- p20.s3 -->

[译文]
我们都认为，我们个人的价值顺序不仅仅是个人的，而且在理性人之间的自由讨论中，我们会说服其他人相信我们的价值顺序才是正确的。<!-- p20.s3 -->

[原文]
> The lover of the countryside who wants above all that its traditional appearance should be preserved and that the blots already made by industry on its fair face should be removed, no less than the health enthusiast who wants all the picturesque but unsanitary old cottages cleared away, or the motorist who wishes the country cut up by big motor roads, the efficiency fanatic who desires the maximum of specialization and mechanization no less than the idealist who for the development of personality wants to preserve as many independent craftsmen as possible, all know that their aim can be fully achieved only by planning—and they all want planning for that reason. <!-- p20.s4 -->

[译文]
热爱乡村的人希望首先保留其传统外观，并清除工业在其美丽面貌上已经造成的污点；健康爱好者希望清除所有风景如画但不卫生的旧小屋；驾车者希望国家被大型公路切割；效率狂热者希望最大限度的专业化和机械化；理想主义者为了人格发展希望保留尽可能多的独立工匠——他们都知道，他们的目标只有通过计划才能充分实现，因此他们都想要计划。<!-- p20.s4 -->

[原文]
> But, of course, the adoption of the social planning for which they clamor can only bring out the concealed conflict between their aims. <!-- p20.s5 -->

[译文]
但是，当然，采纳他们所呼吁的社会计划，只会揭示出他们目标之间隐藏的冲突。<!-- p20.s5 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> The movement for planning owes its present strength largely to the fact that, while planning is in the main still an ambition, it unites almost all the single-minded idealists, all the men and women who have devoted their lives to a single task. <!-- p21.s1 -->

[译文]
计划运动之所以拥有目前的力量,主要是因为，虽然计划在主要方面仍然是一种抱负，但它团结了几乎所有一心一意的理想主义者，所有将生命奉献给单一任务的男女。<!-- p21.s1 -->

[原文]
> The hopes they place in planning, however, are the result not of a comprehensive view of society but rather of a very limited view and often the result of a great exaggeration of the importance of the ends they place foremost. <!-- p21.s2 -->

[译文]
然而，他们对计划寄予的希望，不是源于对社会的全面看法，而是源于非常有限的看法，而且往往是对他们最看重的目标的重要性的极大夸大的结果。<!-- p21.s2 -->

[原文]
> This is not to underrate the great pragmatic value of this type of men in a free society like ours, which makes them the subject of just admiration. <!-- p21.s3 -->

[译文]
这并不是要低估这类人在像我们这样的自由社会中的巨大实用价值，这种价值使他们成为公正赞赏的对象。<!-- p21.s3 -->

[原文]
> But it would make the very men who are most anxious to plan society the most dangerous if they were allowed to do so—and the most intolerant of the planning of others. <!-- p21.s4 -->

[译文]
但是，这会使那些最渴望计划社会的人，如果被允许这样做，就会成为最危险的人——并且对他人的计划最不容忍。<!-- p21.s4 -->

[原文]
> From the saintly and single-minded idealist to the fanatic is often but a step. <!-- p21.s5 -->

[译文]
从圣洁而一心一意的理想主义者到狂热分子，往往只有一步之遥。<!-- p21.s5 -->

[原文]
> Though it is the resentment of the frustrated specialist which gives the demand for planning its strongest impetus, there could hardly be a more unbearable—and more irrational—world than one in which the most eminent specialists in each field were allowed to proceed unchecked with the realization of their ideals. <!-- p21.s6 -->

[译文]
尽管正是受挫专家的怨恨给计划的需求提供了最强大的推动力，但几乎没有比这更难以忍受——也更不理性——的世界了：在这样的世界里，每个领域最杰出的专家被允许不受制约地实现他们的理想。<!-- p21.s6 -->

[原文]
> Nor can "coordination," as some planners seem to imagine, become a new specialism. <!-- p21.s7 -->

[译文]
"协调"也不能像一些计划者似乎想象的那样，成为一种新的专业。<!-- p21.s7 -->

[原文]
> The economist is the last to claim that he has the knowledge which the coordinator would need. His plea is for a method which effects such coordination without the need for an omniscient dictator. <!-- p21.s8 -->

[译文]
经济学家是最不会声称自己拥有协调者所需知识的人。他所恳求的是一种无需全知独裁者就能实现这种协调的方法。<!-- p21.s8 -->

[原文]
> But that means precisely the retention of some such impersonal, and often unintelligible, checks on individual efforts as those against which all specialists chafe. <!-- p21.s9 -->

[译文]
但这恰恰意味着保留某些非人格的、往往难以理解的对个人努力的制约——正是所有专家都对之感到恼火的那种制约。<!-- p21.s9 -->

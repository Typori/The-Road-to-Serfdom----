# Who, Whom?
# 谁制约谁

> 摘要：本章通过"谁制约谁"这个核心问题，深入分析计划社会中权力结构的根本转变。在竞争社会中，无人拥有决定他人命运的绝对权力；但在中央计划中，所有经济活动都由单一权力控制，这必然导致对人口地位的分配成为纯政治问题。本章论证了社会主义理想引发的对分配正义标准的无尽争议，最终导致强势团体利用国家权力压制他人——从而演变出极权主义。

## 第一节：竞争社会中的无人支配原则

[原文]
> The finest opportunity ever given to the world was thrown away because the passion for equality made vain the hope for freedom. —Lord Acton

[译文]
> 世界所获得的最好机会被浪费了，因为对平等的激情使自由的希望化为乌有。——勋爵阿克顿<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is significant that one of the commonest objections to competition is that it is "blind." It is not irrelevant to recall that to the ancients blindness was an attribute of their deity of justice. Although competition and justice may have little else in common, it is as much a commendation of competition as of justice that it is no respecter of persons. That it is impossible to foretell who will be the lucky ones or whom disaster will strike, that rewards and penalties are not shared out according to somebody's views about the merits or demerits of different people but depend on their capacity and their luck, is as important as that, in framing legal rules, we should not be able to predict which particular person will gain and which will lose by their application.

[译文]
> 竞争最常见的反对意见是它是"盲目的"，这很值得重视。回顾一下，对古人而言，盲目是他们正义之神的一个属性，这并非无关紧要。虽然竞争和正义在其他方面可能没有多少共同之处，但竞争和正义同样值得赞许的地方在于——两者都不徇私情。无法预见谁将成为幸运者或谁会遭遇灾难，奖赏和惩罚不是根据某人关于不同人的功劳或缺点的观点来分配的，而是取决于他们的能力和运气——这和在制定法律规则时我们应该无法预测哪个特定的人将从其中获益或受损一样重要。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> And this is nonetheless true, because in competition chance and good luck are often as important as skill and foresight in determining the fate of different people.

[译文]
> 这一点依然成立，因为在竞争中，运气和好运在决定不同人的命运时往往和技能与远见同等重要。<!-- p1.s3 -->

[原文]
> The choice open to us is not between a system in which everybody will get what he deserves according to some absolute and universal standard of right, and one where the individual shares are determined partly by accident or good or ill chance, but between a system where it is the will of a few persons that decides who is to get what, and one where it depends at least partly on the ability and enterprise of the people concerned and partly on unforeseeable circumstances.

[译文]
> 我们面临的选择不是在一个每个人都会根据某种绝对和普遍的公正标准获得应得之物的系统，与一个个人份额部分由事故或幸运或不幸决定的系统之间进行。而是在一个由少数人的意愿决定谁获得什么的系统，与一个至少部分取决于相关人员的能力和创业精神，部分取决于不可预见的情况的系统之间进行。<!-- p1.s4 -->

[原文]
> This is no less relevant because in a system of free enterprise chances are not equal, since such a system is necessarily based on private property and (though perhaps not with the same necessity) on inheritance, with the differences in opportunity which these create. There is, indeed, a strong case for reducing this inequality of opportunity as far as congenital differences permit and as it is possible to do so without destroying the impersonal character of the process by which everybody has to take his chance and no person's view about what is right and desirable overrules that of others.

[译文]
> 这与自由企业制度中机会不平等的事实同样相关，因为这样的制度必然基于私产制，而且（尽管也许不是必然的）基于继承制，这创造了机会上的差异。实际上，有充分的理由支持减少机会上的这种不平等——只要不超过先天差异所允许的范围，并且在不破坏每个人都要碰运气、任何人的"什么是正确和可取的"的观点都不能压倒他人的那种非个人化的过程性质的前提下进行。<!-- p1.s5 -->

---

## 第二节：竞争社会中贫困者的自由优势

[原文]
> The fact that the opportunities open to the poor in a competitive society are much more restricted than those open to the rich does not make it less true that in such a society the poor are much more free than a person commanding much greater material comfort in a different type of society.

[译文]
> 虽然在竞争社会中贫困者获得的机会远不如富人获得的机会那样充足，但这并不改变一个真理：在这样的社会中，贫困者享有的自由远超那些在不同类型社会中物质舒适度远胜他们的人。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> Although under competition the probability that a man who starts poor will reach great wealth is much smaller than is true of the man who has inherited property, it is not only possible for the former, but the competitive system is the only one where it depends solely on him and not on the favors of the mighty, and where nobody can prevent a man from attempting to achieve this result.

[译文]
> 虽然在竞争制度下，白手起家者达到巨大财富的概率远小于继承财产者的概率，但对前者来说这不仅是可能的，而且竞争制度是唯一一个使这种可能性仅取决于他自己而非权势者恩宠的制度，在这个制度中，没有人能阻止任何人尝试实现这一目标。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> It is only because we have forgotten what unfreedom means that we often overlook the patent fact that in every real sense a badly paid unskilled worker in this country has more freedom to shape his life than many a small entrepreneur in Germany or a much better paid engineer or manager in Russia. Whether it is a question of changing his job or the place where he lives, of professing certain views or of spending his leisure in a particular manner, although sometimes the price he may have to pay for following his inclinations may be high, and to many appear too high, there are no absolute impediments, no dangers to bodily security and freedom, that confine him by brute force to the task and the environment to which a superior has assigned him.

[译文]
> 我们之所以常常忽视一个明显的事实，仅仅是因为我们已经忘记了什么叫不自由。这个事实是：就实际意义而言，这个国家里工资低微的非熟练工人的自由程度，要大于德国许多小企业主或俄罗斯薪水优厚得多的工程师或管理人员的自由程度。无论是更换工作、搬迁住处、表达某些观点还是以特定方式消遣，虽然有时追随自己的意愿需要付出高昂的代价，在许多人看来甚至太高了，但没有绝对的障碍、没有对身体安全和自由的危险能把他粗暴地束缚在某个上级为他分配的任务和环境中。<!-- p2.s3 -->

---

## 第三节：私产制作为自由的根本保障

[原文]
> That the ideal of justice of most socialists would be satisfied if merely private income from property were abolished and the differences between the earned incomes of different people remained what they are now is true. What these people forget is that, in transferring all property in the means of production to the state, they put the state in a position whereby its action must in effect decide all other incomes.

[译文]
> 大多数社会主义者的正义理想若仅仅废除私人财产收入、保持不同人群劳动收入的现有差异，就能得到满足，这是真的。但这些人忘记的是，通过把所有生产资料的所有权转移给国家，他们使国家处于这样一个位置：国家的任何行动必然会实际上决定所有其他收入。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> The power thus given to the state and the demand that the state should use it to "plan" means nothing else than that it should use it in full awareness of all these effects.

[译文]
> 因此赋予国家的权力，以及要求国家利用这种权力进行"计划"的呼声，归根结底不过意味着国家应该在充分意识到所有这些影响的情况下行使这种权力。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> To believe that the power which is thus conferred on the state is merely transferred to it from others is erroneous. It is a power which is newly created and which in a competitive society nobody possesses. So long as property is divided among many owners, none of them acting independently has exclusive power to determine the income and position of particular people—nobody is tied to any one property owner except by the fact that he may offer better terms than anybody else.

[译文]
> 认为赋予国家的权力仅仅是从他人转移而来是错误的。这是一种新创造的权力，在竞争社会中不属于任何人。只要财产分散在众多所有者手中，其中任何一个单独行动的所有者都没有独占决定特定人群收入和地位的权力——没有人被束缚于任何一个财产所有者，除非这个所有者能提供比任何其他所有者都更优惠的条件。<!-- p3.s3 -->

[原文]
> What our generation has forgotten is that the system of private property is the most important guaranty of freedom, not only for those who own property, but scarcely less for those who do not. It is only because the control of the means of production is divided among many people acting independently that nobody has complete power over us, that we as individuals can decide what to do with ourselves. If all the means of production were vested in a single hand, whether it be nominally that of "society" as a whole or that of a dictator, whoever exercises this control has complete power over us.

[译文]
> 我们这一代人遗忘的是：私产制是最重要的自由保障，不仅对那些拥有财产的人如此，对那些没有财产的人也几乎同样重要。正是因为生产资料的控制权分散在许多独立行动的人手中，才没有人对我们拥有完全的权力，我们作为个人才能决定自己如何行动。若所有生产资料都集中在一只手中——无论名义上是"整个社会"还是独裁者——那么掌握这种控制的人就对我们拥有完全的权力。<!-- p3.s4 -->

[原文]
> Who can seriously doubt that a member of a small racial or religious minority will be freer with no property so long as fellow-members of his community have property and are therefore able to employ him, than he would be if private property were abolished and he became owner of a nominal share in the communal property? Or that the power which a multiple millionaire, who may be my neighbor and perhaps my employer, has over me is very much less than that which the smallest fonctionnaire possesses who wields the coercive power of the state and on whose discretion it depends whether and how I am to be allowed to live or to work?

[译文]
> 谁能真正怀疑，一个小型种族或宗教少数族裔的成员，即使没有财产，只要他社区的同胞有财产因而能够雇佣他，他就会比私产制被废除、他成为公共财产名义股东的情况下更自由？或者，一个可能是我的邻居、也许是我的雇主的百万富翁对我的权力，会远小于掌握国家强制力的最小的官员对我的权力——而这个官员可以自行决定我是否被允许生活或工作，以及如何生活或工作？<!-- p3.s5 -->

[原文]
> And who will deny that a world in which the wealthy are powerful is still a better world than one in which only the already powerful can acquire wealth?

[译文]
> 谁会否认，一个富人有权势的世界仍然优于一个只有既得权势者才能获得财富的世界？<!-- p3.s6 -->

---

## 第四节：分配正义的困境与权力的必然集中

[原文]
> It is pathetic, yet at the same time encouraging, to find as prominent an old communist as Max Eastman rediscovering this truth: "It seems obvious to me now—though I have been slow, I must say, in coming to the conclusion—that the institution of private property is one of the main things that have given man that limited amount of free-and-equalness that Marx hoped to render infinite by abolishing this institution. Strangely enough Marx was the first to see this. He is the one who informed us, looking backwards, that the evolution of private capitalism with its free market had been a precondition for the evolution of all our democratic freedoms. It never occurred to him, looking forward, that if this was so, these other freedoms might disappear with the abolition of the free market."

[译文]
> 看到一位著名的老共产主义者马克斯·伊斯曼重新发现这一真理，既令人心酸，又鼓舞人心。他写道："我现在觉得这是显而易见的——虽然我必须承认，我来到这个结论的速度很慢——私产制度是给予人类那份有限的自由与平等的主要因素之一，而马克思曾希望通过废除这一制度来使其无限增长。奇怪的是，马克思首先看到了这一点。他向我们回顾性地阐明，私有资本主义及其自由市场的演进曾是我们所有民主自由演进的前提条件。他在前瞻时没有想到，如果情况确实如此，那么这些其他的自由可能会随着自由市场的废除而消失。"<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is sometimes said, in answer to such apprehensions, that there is no reason why the planner should determine the incomes of individuals. The social and political difficulties involved in deciding the shares of different people in the national income are so obvious that even the most inveterate planner may well hesitate before he charges any authority with this task.

[译文]
> 针对这样的担忧，有时会有人说，计划者没有理由非要决定个人的收入。决定不同人群在国民收入中的份额所涉及的社会和政治难题是如此明显，以至于即使是最积极的计划者在将这一任务委派给任何权力机构之前，也可能会有所迟疑。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> Probably everybody who realizes what it involves would prefer to confine planning to production, to use it only to secure a "rational organization of industry," leaving the distribution of incomes as far as possible to impersonal forces. Although it is impossible to direct industry without exercising some influence on distribution, and although no planner will wish to leave distribution entirely to the forces of the market, they would probably all prefer to confine themselves to seeing that this distribution conforms to certain general rules of equity and fairness, that extreme inequalities are avoided, and that the relation between the remuneration of the major classes is just, without undertaking the responsibility for the position of particular people within their class or for the gradations and differentiations between smaller groups and individuals.

[译文]
> 任何真正理解这一点的人都可能倾向于把计划限制在生产领域，仅用它来实现"工业的理性组织"，尽可能让收入分配由非人格化的力量决定。虽然不通过对分配施加某种影响就无法指导工业，而且没有计划者愿意让分配完全由市场力量决定，但他们可能都倾向于仅限于确保分配符合某些一般的公平和公正原则，避免极端不平等，确保主要阶级间的报酬关系是正义的——而不承担对特定人群在其阶级内的地位，或较小群体和个人之间的等级差异的责任。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> We have already seen that the close interdependence of all economic phenomena makes it difficult to stop planning just where we wish and that, once the free working of the market is impeded beyond a certain degree, the planner will be forced to extend his controls until they become all-comprehensive.

[译文]
> 我们已经看到，所有经济现象之间的密切相互依赖性使得在我们希望的地方停止计划变得困难，一旦市场的自由运作被阻碍到一定程度，计划者就会被迫扩展他的控制，直到它们变成无所不包。<!-- p4.s4 -->

---

## 第五节：计划下的权力政治化与阶级冲突

[原文]
> These economic considerations, which explain why it is impossible to stop deliberate control just where we should wish, are strongly reinforced by certain social or political tendencies whose strength makes itself increasingly felt as planning extends.

[译文]
> 这些经济考虑解释了为什么无法在我们希望的地方停止有意控制，它们受到某些社会或政治倾向的强力强化——这些倾向随着计划的扩展而力量日增。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> Once it becomes increasingly true, and is generally recognized, that the position of the individual is determined not by impersonal forces, not as a result of the competitive effort of many, but by the deliberate decision of authority, the attitude of the people toward their position in the social order necessarily changes.

[译文]
> 一旦人们越来越真切地认识到、并得到普遍承认，个人的地位不是由非人格化的力量决定的，不是众多竞争努力的结果，而是由权力机构的蓄意决定决定的，那么人民对自己在社会秩序中地位的态度必然会改变。<!-- p5.s2 -->

[原文]
> There will always exist inequalities which will appear unjust to those who suffer from them, disappointments which will appear unmerited, and strokes of misfortune which those hit have not deserved. But when these things occur in a society which is consciously directed, the way in which people will react will be very different from what it is when they are nobody's conscious choice.

[译文]
> 总会存在某些不平等对受害者显得不公正，某些失望显得不应该发生，某些不幸遭遇显得不是活该的。但当这些事情发生在一个被有意识地指导的社会中时，人们的反应方式会与这些事情是无人有意做出的选择时大相径庭。<!-- p5.s3 -->

[原文]
> Inequality is undoubtedly more readily borne, and affects the dignity of the person much less, if it is determined by impersonal forces than when it is due to design. In a competitive society it is no slight to a person, no offense to his dignity, to be told by any particular firm that it has no need for his services or that it cannot offer him a better job.

[译文]
> 不平等无疑更容易被忍受，对个人尊严的伤害也更小——若它是由非人格化的力量决定的，而非由人的设计导致。在竞争社会中，被某个特定企业告知它无需其服务或无法提供更好的工作，这对这个人不是耻辱，不是对其尊严的侮辱。<!-- p5.s4 -->

[原文]
> It is true that in periods of prolonged mass unemployment the effect on many may be very similar. But there are other and better methods to prevent that scourge than central direction. But the unemployment or the loss of income which will always affect some in any society is certainly less degrading if it is the result of misfortune and not deliberately imposed by authority. However bitter the experience, it would be very much worse in a planned society.

[译文]
> 诚然，在长期大规模失业时期，对许多人的影响可能非常相似。但防止这一灾难有其他更好的方法，而非中央指挥。无论如何，失业或收入损失——在任何社会中都会影响某些人——如果是不幸的结果而非权力机构故意施加，无疑会更少屈辱。无论经历多么痛苦，在计划社会中会糟糕得多。<!-- p5.s5 -->

[原文]
> There individuals will have to decide not whether a person is needed for a particular job but whether he is of use for anything, and how useful he is. His position in life must be assigned to him by somebody else.

[译文]
> 在那里，个人将必须面对的问题不是他对某个特定工作是否有用，而是他是否对任何事情有用，以及他有多大用处。他的人生地位必须由别人分配给他。<!-- p5.s6 -->

[原文]
> While people will submit to suffering which may hit anyone, they will not so easily submit to suffering which is the result of the decision of authority. It may be bad to be just a cog in an impersonal machine; but it is infinitely worse if we can no longer leave it, if we are tied to our place and to the superiors who have been chosen for us. Dissatisfaction of everybody with his lot will inevitably grow with the consciousness that it is the result of deliberate human decision.

[译文]
> 人们愿意忍受可能击中任何人的苦难，但不会那么容易忍受权力机构决策结果的苦难。仅仅成为非人格机器中的一个齿轮可能很糟糕；但如果我们不能再离开它，如果我们被束缚在自己的位置和为我们选定的上级身边，就会无限糟糕。随着人们意识到自己的处境是有意的人为决定的结果，每个人对自己命运的不满必然会与日俱增。<!-- p5.s7 -->

## 第六节："谁制约谁"问题的根本性与权力的必然不平等

[原文]
> Once government has embarked upon planning for the sake of justice, it cannot refuse responsibility for anybody's fate or position. In a planned society we shall all know that we are better or worse off than others, not because of circumstances which nobody controls, and which it is impossible to foresee with certainty, but because some authority wills it. And all our efforts directed toward improving our position will have to aim, not at foreseeing and preparing as well as we can for the circumstances over which we have no control, but at influencing in our favor the authority which has all the power.

[译文]
> 一旦政府开始为了正义而进行计划，就无法拒绝对任何人的命运或地位负责。在一个计划社会中，我们都会知道，我们比他人过得更好还是更差，不是因为无人控制、无法确定预见的情况，而是因为某个权力机构的意愿。我们为改善自己地位所做的一切努力，将不得不旨在不是尽可能好地预见和为我们无法控制的情况做准备，而是为了影响那个掌握所有权力的权力机构对我们有利。<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> The nightmare of English nineteenth-century political thinkers, the state in which "no avenue to wealth and honor would exist save through the government," would be realized in a completeness which they never imagined—though familiar enough in some countries which have since passed to totalitarianism.

[译文]
> 英国十九世纪政治思想家们的梦魇——"除了通过政府外，获得财富和荣誉就不存在任何途径"的国家——将以他们从未想象过的完整形式得以实现——虽然在某些后来沦为极权主义的国家中已经司空见惯。<!-- p6.s2 -->

[原文]
> As soon as the state takes upon itself the task of planning the whole economic life, the problem of the due station of the different individuals and groups must indeed inevitably become the central political problem. As the coercive power of the state will alone decide who is to have what, the only power worth having will be a share in the exercise of this directing power. There will be no economic or social questions that would not be political questions in the sense that their solution will depend exclusively on who wields the coercive power, on whose are the views that will prevail on all occasions.

[译文]
> 一旦国家承担起规划整个经济生活的任务，不同个人和群体应有地位的问题必然会成为中央政治问题。由于国家的强制权力将单独决定谁获得什么，唯一值得拥有的权力就是分享这种指导权力的行使权。不会有任何经济或社会问题不是政治问题——因为在这种意义上，它们的解决方案完全取决于谁掌握强制权力，取决于谁的观点会在所有场合占上风。<!-- p6.s3 -->

[原文]
> I believe it was Lenin himself who introduced to Russia the famous phrase "who, whom?"—during the early years of Soviet rule the byword in which the people summed up the universal problem of a socialist society. Who plans whom, who directs and dominates whom, who assigns to other people their station in life, and who is to have his due allotted by others? These become necessarily the central issues to be decided solely by the supreme power.

[译文]
> 我认为正是列宁本人把"谁制约谁？"这个著名的短语引入了俄罗斯——在苏维埃统治的早期，这成了人民总结社会主义社会普遍问题的口头禅。谁计划谁，谁指挥和支配谁，谁给他人分配人生地位，谁的应得之物将由他人分配？这些必然成为仅由最高权力决定的中心问题。<!-- p6.s4 -->

[原文]
> More recently an American student of politics has enlarged upon Lenin's phrase and asserted that the problem of all government is "who gets what, when, and how." In a way this is not untrue. That all government affects the relative position of different people and that there is under any system scarcely an aspect of our lives which may not be affected by government action is certainly true.

[译文]
> 最近，一位美国政治学家扩展了列宁的措辞，声称所有政府的问题是"谁获得什么、何时获得和如何获得"。在某种意义上，这并非虚言。确实，所有政府都会影响不同人群的相对地位，在任何制度下几乎没有我们生活的某个方面不会受政府行为的影响。<!-- p6.s5 -->

[原文]
> In so far as government does anything at all, its action will always have some effect on "who gets what, when, and how."

[译文]
> 只要政府做任何事情，其行为就总会对"谁获得什么、何时获得和如何获得"产生某种影响。<!-- p6.s6 -->

[原文]
> There are, however, two fundamental distinctions to be made. First, particular measures may be taken without the possibility of knowing how they will affect particular individuals and therefore without aiming at such particular effects. This point we have already discussed. Second, it is the extent of the activities of the government which decides whether everything that any person gets any time depends on the government, or whether its influence is confined to whether some people will get some things in some way at some time. Here lies the whole difference between a free and a totalitarian system.

[译文]
> 然而，需要做出两个根本的区分。第一，可以采取某些措施而无须知道它们将如何影响特定个人，因此不是以实现这样的特定效应为目标。我们已经讨论过这一点。第二，政府活动的范围决定了任何人在任何时间获得的一切是否都取决于政府，或者政府的影响是否仅限于某些人在某个时间以某种方式获得某些东西。在这里，自由制度和极权制度之间的整个区别就在于此。<!-- p6.s7 -->

[原文]
> The contrast between a liberal and a totally planned system is characteristically illustrated by the common complaints of Nazis and socialists of the "artificial separations of economics and politics" and by their equally common demand for the dominance of politics over economics. These phrases presumably mean not only that economic forces are now allowed to work for ends which are not part of the policy of the government but also that economic power can be used independently of government direction and for ends of which the government may not approve.

[译文]
> 自由制和完全计划制之间的对比，特征性地体现在纳粹分子和社会主义者对"经济与政治的人为分离"的普遍抱怨，以及他们同样普遍的"政治应该支配经济"的要求中。这些措辞大概意味着，不仅经济力量现在被允许为不是政府政策一部分的目的而发挥作用，而且经济权力可以独立于政府指导而被使用，可以用于政府不赞成的目的。<!-- p6.s8 -->

[原文]
> But the alternative is not merely that there should be only one power but that this single power, the ruling group, should have control over all human ends and particularly that it should have complete power over the position of each individual in society.

[译文]
> 但替代方案不仅仅是只有一种权力，而是这个单一的权力——统治集团——应该对所有人类的目的拥有控制权，特别是对社会中每个个人的地位拥有完全的权力。<!-- p6.s9 -->

## 第七节：分配正义标准的缺失与权力的必然滥用

[原文]
> That a government which undertakes to direct economic activity will have to use its power to realize somebody's ideal of distributive justice is certain. But how can and how will it use that power? By what principles will it or ought it be guided? Is there a definite answer to the innumerable questions of relative merits that will arise and that will have to be solved deliberately? Is there a scale of values, on which reasonable people can be expected to agree, which would justify a new hierarchical order of society and is likely to satisfy the demands for justice?

[译文]
> 承诺指导经济活动的政府必然要用其权力来实现某人关于分配正义的理想，这是确定的。但它如何能够以及将如何使用这种权力呢？什么原则会也应该指导它？对将会出现且必须有意解决的无数相对优劣问题，是否存在确定的答案？是否存在一种价值标度——理智的人可以预期就此达成共识——能够为社会的新等级制度辩护，并有可能满足对正义的要求？<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> There is only one general principle, one simple rule which would indeed provide a definite answer to all these questions: equality, complete and absolute equality of all individuals in all those points which are subject to human control. If this were generally regarded as desirable (quite apart from the question whether it would be practicable, i.e., whether it would provide adequate incentives), it would give the vague idea of distributive justice a clear meaning and would give the planner definite guidance.

[译文]
> 只有一个总原则、一条简单规则能够真正为所有这些问题提供确定的答案：平等，即在所有受人类控制的方面完全而绝对的平等。若这被普遍视为可取的（先不论它是否切实可行，即是否能提供充分的激励），它就会赋予分配正义这个模糊理念以清晰的含义，并给计划者确定的指导。<!-- p7.s2 -->

[原文]
> But nothing is further from the truth than that people in general regard mechanical equality of this kind as desirable. No socialist movement which aimed at complete equality has ever gained substantial support. What socialism promised was not an absolutely equal, but a more just and more equal, distribution. Not equality in the absolute sense but "greater equality" is the only goal which is seriously aimed at.

[译文]
> 但把这种机械平等视为可取的观点离真实最远。历来没有哪个追求完全平等的社会主义运动获得过实质性的支持。社会主义承诺的不是绝对相等的，而是更公正和更平等的分配。不是绝对意义上的平等，而仅仅是"更大的平等"，才是真正被认真追求的唯一目标。<!-- p7.s3 -->

[原文]
> Though these two ideals sound very similar, they are as different as possible as far as our problem is concerned. While absolute equality would clearly determine the planner's task, the desire for greater equality is merely negative, no more than an expression of dislike of the present state of affairs; and so long as we are not prepared to say that every move in the direction toward complete equality is desirable, it answers scarcely any of the questions the planner will have to decide.

[译文]
> 虽然这两个理想听起来非常相似，但就我们的问题而言，它们却差异巨大。绝对平等会明确决定计划者的任务，而对更大平等的渴望仅仅是消极的，不过是对现状的厌恶表达；只要我们没有准备好说"朝向完全平等的每一步都是可取的"，它就几乎无法回答计划者必须决定的任何问题。<!-- p7.s4 -->

[原文]
> This is not a quibble about words. We face here a crucial issue which the similarity of the terms used is likely to conceal. While agreement on complete equality would answer all the problems of merit the planner must answer, the formula of the approach to greater equality answers practically none. Its content is hardly more definite than the phrases "common good" or "social welfare." It does not free us from the necessity of deciding in every particular instance between the merits of particular individuals or groups, and it gives us no help in that decision. All it tells us in effect is to take from the rich as much as we can. But, when it comes to the distribution of the spoils, the problem is the same as if the formula of "greater equality" had never been conceived.

[译文]
> 这不是词汇的吹毛求疵。我们在这里面对一个关键问题，这个问题可能被所使用术语的相似性所掩盖。虽然对完全平等的共识会解答计划者必须回答的所有功过问题，但"更大平等的方向"这个公式实际上无法解答任何问题。其内容几乎不比"共同福祉"或"社会福利"这样的短语更确定。它不能使我们免除在每个具体案例中判断特定个人或群体的优劣的必要性，也无法在这一判断中帮助我们。实际上，它所告诉我们的仅仅是尽可能多地从富人那里夺取。但当涉及到战利品的分配时，问题和从未出现过"更大平等"这一公式是一样的。<!-- p7.s5 -->

## 第八节：社会主义的权力工具与极权主义的起源

[原文]
> Most people find it difficult to admit that we do not possess moral standards which would enable us to settle these questions—if not perfectly, at least to greater general satisfaction than is done by the competitive system. Have we not all some idea of what is a "just price" or a "fair wage"? Can we not rely on the strong sense of fairness of the people? And even if we do not now agree fully on what is just or fair in a particular case, would popular ideas not soon consolidate into more definite standards if people were given an opportunity to see their ideals realized?

[译文]
> 大多数人很难承认，我们没有道德标准能够解决这些问题——即使不是完美地，至少也比竞争系统所做的更令人满意。我们是不是都对什么是"公正价格"或"公平工资"有某种想法？我们是否不能依赖人民强烈的公平感？即使我们现在在某个具体案例中对什么是公正或公平还没有完全达成一致，若人民有机会看到他们的理想得以实现，他们的观念是否不会很快凝聚成更明确的标准？<!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> Unfortunately, there is little ground for such hopes. What standards we have are derived from the competitive regime we have known and would necessarily disappear soon after the disappearance of competition. What we mean by a just price, or a fair wage is either the customary price or wage, the return which past experience has made people expect, or the price or wage that would exist if there were no monopolistic exploitation.

[译文]
> 不幸的是，这样的希望几乎没有根据。我们拥有的标准来自我们所知的竞争制度，会在竞争消失后不久必然消失。我们所说的公正价格或公平工资，要么是习惯的价格或工资，是过去的经验使人们期待的回报，要么是在没有垄断剥削的情况下会存在的价格或工资。<!-- p8.s2 -->

[原文]
> The only important exception to this used to be the claim of the workers to the "full produce of their labor," to which so much of socialist doctrine traces back. But there are few socialists today who believe that in a socialist society the output of each industry would be entirely shared by the workers of that industry; for this would mean that workers in industries using a great deal of capital would have a much larger income than those in industries using little capital, which most socialists would regard as very unjust.

[译文]
> 这个唯一重要的例外过去是工人对"劳动的全部产品"的要求，许多社会主义理论都追溯到这一点。但今天很少有社会主义者相信在社会主义社会中每个工业的产出将完全由该工业的工人共享；因为这意味着在资本密集型工业中工作的工人的收入会远大于在资本稀少型工业中工作的工人，这是大多数社会主义者会认为非常不公正的。<!-- p8.s3 -->

[原文]
> And it is now fairly generally agreed that this particular claim was based on an erroneous interpretation of the facts. But once the claim of the individual worker to the whole of "his" product is disallowed, and the whole of the return from capital is to be divided among all workers, the problem of how to divide it raises the same basic issue.

[译文]
> 现在人们普遍同意，这一特定要求基于对事实的错误理解。但一旦否定了个别工人对"他的"全部产品的要求，而把来自资本的全部回报分配给所有工人，那么如何分配它的问题就引发了同样的根本问题。<!-- p8.s4 -->

[原文]
> What the "just price" of a particular commodity or the "fair" remuneration for a particular service is might conceivably be determined objectively if the quantities needed were independently fixed. If these were given irrespective of cost, the planner might try to find what price or wage is necessary to bring forth this supply. But the planner must also decide how much is to be produced of each kind of goods, and, in so doing, he determines what will be the just price or fair wage to pay.

[译文]
> 某特定商品的"公正价格"或某特定服务的"公平"报酬，若所需数量是独立确定的，可能客观地决定。若这些数量不考虑成本而被给定，计划者可能会尝试找出必要的价格或工资来提供这个数量。但计划者也必须决定每种商品要生产多少，在这样做时，他决定了所谓的公正价格或公平工资是什么。<!-- p8.s5 -->

[原文]
> If the planner decides that fewer architects or watchmakers are wanted and that the need can be met by those who are willing to stay in the trade at a lower remuneration, the "fair" wage will be lower. In deciding the relative importance of the different ends, the planner also decides the relative importance of the different groups and persons. As he is not supposed to treat the people merely as a means, he must take account of these effects and consciously balance the importance of the different ends against the effects of his decision. This means, however, that he will necessarily exercise direct control over the conditions of the different people.

[译文]
> 若计划者决定需要较少的建筑师或钟表匠，而需求可以由那些愿意以较低报酬留在这一行业的人满足，那么"公平"工资就会更低。在决定不同目标的相对重要性时，计划者也决定了不同群体和个人的相对重要性。既然他不应该仅把人民作为手段看待，他必须考虑这些影响，有意地平衡不同目标的重要性与其决定的影响。然而这意味着他必然会对不同人民的条件施加直接控制。<!-- p8.s6 -->

[原文]
> This applies to the relative position of individuals no less than to that of the different occupational groups. We are in general far too likely to think of incomes within a given trade or profession as more or less uniform. But the differences between the incomes, not only of the most and the least successful doctor or architect, writer or movie actor, boxer or jockey, but also of the more and the less successful plumber or market gardener, grocer or tailor, are as great as those between the propertied and the propertyless classes.

[译文]
> 这同样适用于个人间的相对地位，如同不同职业群体间的相对地位。我们一般来说太倾向于认为某一特定行业或专业内的收入或多或少是统一的。但收入的差异——不仅存在于最成功和最不成功的医生或建筑师、作家或电影演员、拳击手或骑师之间，也存在于更成功和不太成功的水管工人或园艺商人、杂货商或裁缝之间——与有产者和无产者阶级间的差异一样大。<!-- p8.s7 -->

[原文]
> And although, no doubt, there would be some attempt at standardization by creating categories, the necessity of discrimination between individuals would remain the same, whether it were exercised by fixing their individual incomes or by allocating them to particular categories.

[译文]
> 虽然无疑会有通过创建类别进行某种标准化的尝试，但个人之间的区别对待的必要性将保持不变，无论是通过规定他们的个人收入还是通过把他们分配到特定类别来进行。<!-- p8.s8 -->

[原文]
> We need say no more about the likelihood of men in a free society submitting to such control—or about their remaining free if they submitted. On the whole question, what John Stuart Mill wrote nearly a hundred years ago remains equally true today: "A fixed rule, like that of equality, might be acquiesced in, and so might chance, or an external necessity; but that a handful of human beings should weigh everybody in the balance, and give more to one and less to another at their sole pleasure and judgment, would not be borne unless from persons believed to be more than men, and backed by supernatural terrors."

[译文]
> 关于自由社会中的人们愿意接受这种控制的可能性，或关于若他们提交就能保持自由的可能性，我们无需再多说。对整个问题而言，约翰·斯图尔特·穆勒近百年前写下的话至今依然同等真实："一项固定的规则，如平等的规则，可能会被接受，运气或外部必然性也可能如此；但少数人应该把每个人放在天平上衡量，根据他们单独的意愿和判断给一个人更多、给另一个人更少——除非这些人被视为超越人类的存在、或受超自然恐怖的支撑，否则这不会被忍受。"<!-- p8.s9 -->

## 第九节：社会主义的权力结构转变与极权主义的出现

[原文]
> These difficulties need not lead to open clashes so long as socialism is merely the aspiration of a limited and fairly homogeneous group. They come to the surface only when a socialist policy is actually attempted with the support of the many different groups which together compose the majority of a people. Then it soon becomes the one burning question which of the different sets of ideals shall be imposed upon all by making the whole resources of the country serve it.

[译文]
> 只要社会主义仅仅是一个有限且相当同质群体的抱负，这些困难就不必导致公开冲突。只有当社会主义政策在许多不同群体——这些群体合在一起构成人民多数——的支持下真正付诸实施时，它们才会浮出水面。那时，哪一套理想将被强加于所有人身上——通过让整个国家资源为其服务——很快就成为唯一迫切的问题。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is because successful planning requires the creation of a common view on the essential values that the restriction of our freedom with regard to material things touches so directly on our spiritual freedom.

[译文]
> 正是因为成功的计划需要在基本价值观上创造共同的看法，对物质事务上自由的限制才会如此直接地触及我们精神自由的限制。<!-- p9.s2 -->

[原文]
> Socialists, the cultivated parents of the barbarous offspring they have produced, traditionally hope to solve this problem by education. But what does education mean in this respect? Surely we have learned that knowledge cannot create new ethical values, that no amount of learning will lead people to hold the same views on the moral issues which a conscious ordering of all social relations raises.

[译文]
> 社会主义者——他们所产生的野蛮后代的文明父母——传统上希望通过教育来解决这个问题。但在这方面教育意味着什么呢？我们肯定已经了解到，知识无法创造新的伦理价值，没有多少学习能够使人们在有意识地规划所有社会关系所引发的道德问题上持有相同观点。<!-- p9.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is not rational conviction but the acceptance of a creed which is required to justify a particular plan. And, indeed, socialists everywhere were the first to recognize that the task they had set themselves required the general acceptance of a common Weltanschauung, of a definite set of values. It was in these efforts to produce a mass movement supported by such a single world view that the socialists first created most of the instruments of indoctrination of which Nazis and Fascists have made such effective use.

[译文]
> 不是理性的信念，而是对信条的接受，才是为一个特定计划辩护所必需的。而且实际上，全世界的社会主义者最先认识到他们为自己设定的任务需要一个共同的世界观、一套明确价值观的普遍接受。正是在这些创造一个由这样单一世界观支撑的群众运动的努力中，社会主义者们首次创造了纳粹分子和法西斯分子后来如此有效地利用的大部分灌输工具。<!-- p9.s4 -->

[原文]
> In Germany and Italy the Nazis and Fascists did, indeed, not have much to invent. The usages of the new political movements which pervaded all aspects of life had in both countries already been introduced by the socialists. The idea of a political party which embraces all activities of the individual from the cradle to the grave, which claims to guide his views on everything, and which delights in making all problems questions of party Weltanschauung, was first put into practice by the socialists.

[译文]
> 在德国和意大利，纳粹分子和法西斯分子确实没有多少要发明的。渗透生活各个方面的新政治运动的用法在两个国家都已由社会主义者引入。一个政治党从摇篮到坟墓拥抱个人的所有活动、声称指导他在一切问题上的观点、并且乐于把所有问题变成党的世界观问题的理想，最初是由社会主义者付诸实践的。<!-- p9.s5 -->

[原文]
> An Austrian socialist writer, speaking of the socialist movement of his country, reports with pride that it was its "characteristic feature that it created special organizations for every field of activities of workers and employees."

[译文]
> 一位奥地利社会主义作家在谈及他国家的社会主义运动时，骄傲地报道说其"特征是为工人和雇员的每个活动领域创建了特殊的组织"。<!-- p9.s6 -->

[原文]
> Though the Austrian socialists may have gone further in this respect than others, the situation was not very different elsewhere. It was not the Fascists but the socialists who began to collect children from the tenderest age into political organizations to make sure that they grew up as good proletarians. It was not the Fascists but the socialists who first thought of organizing sports and games, football and hiking, in party clubs where the members would not be infected by other views. It was the socialists who first insisted that the party member should distinguish himself from others by the modes of greeting and the forms of address. It was they who by their organization of "cells" and devices for the permanent supervision of private life created the prototype of the totalitarian party. Balilla and Hitlerjugend, Dopolavoro and Kraft durch Freude, political uniforms and military party formations, are all little more than imitations of older socialist institutions.

[译文]
> 虽然奥地利社会主义者在这方面可能走得比其他人更远，但情况在别处也没有太大不同。不是法西斯分子而是社会主义者开始从最幼小的年龄起就把儿童收入政治组织，以确保他们长大成为优秀的无产者。不是法西斯分子而是社会主义者首先想到在党的俱乐部中组织体育和游戏、足球和登山，在那里成员不会被其他观点所影响。是社会主义者首先坚持党员应该通过打招呼的方式和称呼的形式使自己与他人区别开来。是他们通过组织"细胞"和对私生活进行永久监督的装置创造了极权党的原型。芭莉拉和希特勒青年、多波拉沃罗和通过喜悦获得力量，政治制服和军事党派编队，都不过是较早的社会主义机构的仿制品。<!-- p9.s7 -->

## 第十节：社会主义权力竞争中的阶级冲突与法西斯主义的兴起

[原文]
> So long as the socialist movement in a country is closely bound up with the interests of a particular group, usually the more highly skilled industrial workers, the problem of creating a common view on the desirable status of the different members of society is comparatively simple. The movement is immediately concerned with the status of one particular group, and its aim is to raise that status relatively to other groups. The character of the problem changes, however, as in the course of the progressive advance toward socialism it becomes more and more evident to everyone that his income and general position are determined by the coercive apparatus of the state, that he can maintain or improve his position only as a member of an organized group capable of influencing or controlling the state machine in his interest.

[译文]
> 只要国家中的社会主义运动与特定群体——通常是更高技能的工业工人——的利益紧密相连，创造社会不同成员所应具备地位的共同观点的问题就相对简单。运动立即关涉一个特定群体的地位，其目标是相对于其他群体提高这个群体的地位。然而，随着社会主义的逐步推进，问题的性质会改变——对每个人来说，他的收入和总体地位越来越明显地由国家的强制装置决定，他只能作为一个有能力影响或控制国家机器来维护自身利益的有组织的群体成员来维持或改善自己的地位。<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> In the tug-of-war between the various pressure groups which arises at this stage, it is by no means necessary that the interests of the poorest and most numerous groups should prevail. Nor is it necessarily an advantage for the older socialist parties, who avowedly represented the interests of a particular group, to have been the first in the field and to have designed their whole ideology to appeal to the manual workers in industry. Their very success, and their insistence on the acceptance of the whole creed, is bound to create a powerful countermovement— not by the capitalists but by the very large and equally propertyless classes who find their relative status threatened by the advance of the élite of the industrial workers.

[译文]
> 在这一阶段出现的各种压力集团之间的权力争夺中，最贫困和最众多群体的利益获胜绝非必然。对那些公然代表特定群体利益、率先进入这一领域、设计了整个意识形态来吸引工业中的手工工人的老社会主义政党，率先进入这一领域也不必然是优势。他们的成功本身，以及他们坚持接受整个信条的做法，必然会创造一个强大的反浪潮——不是来自资本家，而是来自非常庞大的、同样无产的阶级，这些阶级发现自己的相对地位受到工业工人精英进步的威胁。<!-- p10.s2 -->

[原文]
> Socialist theory and socialist tactics, even where they have not been dominated by Marxist dogma, have been based everywhere on the idea of a division of society into two classes with common but mutually conflicting interests: capitalists and industrial workers. Socialism counted on a rapid disappearance of the old middle class and completely disregarded the rise of a new middle class, the countless army of clerks and typists, administrative workers and schoolteachers, tradesmen and small officials, and the lower ranks of the professions.

[译文]
> 社会主义理论和社会主义策略，即使没有被马克思主义教条所支配，也都基于一个社会分为两个阶级的想法——这两个阶级有共同利益但利益相冲突：资本家和工业工人。社会主义期待旧中产阶级迅速消失，并完全无视新中产阶级的兴起——这个庞大的书记员和打字员、行政工作者和教师、商人和小官员、以及专业人士低层的队伍。<!-- p10.s3 -->

[原文]
> For a time these classes often provided many of the leaders of the labor movement. But as it became increasingly clear that the position of those classes was deteriorating relatively to that of the industrial workers, the ideals which guided the latter lost much of their appeal to the others. While they were all socialists in the sense that they disliked the capitalist system and wanted a deliberate sharing-out of wealth according to their ideas of justice, these ideas proved to be very different from those embodied in the practice of the older socialist parties.

[译文]
> 在一段时期内，这些阶级常常为劳动运动提供许多领导人。但当这些阶级的地位相对于工业工人的地位正在恶化变得越来越清楚时，指导后者的理想对前者失去了很大的吸引力。虽然他们在不满资本主义制度、想要根据自己对正义的想法刻意重新分配财富的意义上都是社会主义者，但这些想法证明与老社会主义政党实践所体现的想法大不相同。<!-- p10.s4 -->

[原文]
> The means which the old socialist parties had successfully employed to secure the support of one occupational group—the raising of their relative economic position—cannot be used to secure the support of all. There are bound to arise rival socialist movements that appeal to the support of those whose relative position is worsened. There is a great deal of truth in the often heard statement that fascism and National Socialism are a sort of middle-class socialism— only that in Italy and Germany the supporters of these new movements were economically hardly a middle class any longer.

[译文]
> 老社会主义政党成功用来争取一个职业群体支持的手段——提高他们的相对经济地位——无法用来争取所有人的支持。必然会出现对立的社会主义运动，吸引那些相对地位恶化的人的支持。"法西斯主义和国家社会主义是一种中产阶级社会主义"这一经常听到的说法有很大的真理性——只是在意大利和德国，这些新运动的支持者经济上已经几乎不是中产阶级了。<!-- p10.s5 -->

[原文]
> It was to a large extent a revolt of a new underprivileged class against the labor aristocracy which the industrial labor movement had created.

[译文]
> 这在很大程度上是一个新的被剥夺特权的阶级对工业劳动运动所创造的劳动贵族的反抗。<!-- p10.s6 -->

[原文]
> There can be little doubt that no single economic factor has contributed more to help these movements than the envy of the unsuccessful professional man, the university-trained engineer or lawyer, and of the "white-collared proletariat" in general, of the engine driver or compositor and other members of the strongest trade-unions whose income was many times theirs.

[译文]
> 毫无疑问，没有哪个经济因素比不成功的专业人士——受过大学教育的工程师或律师——以及"白领无产阶级"总体上对引擎司机或排字工以及其他收入是他们许多倍的最强大工会成员的嫉妒对帮助这些运动的贡献更大。<!-- p10.s7 -->

[原文]
> Nor can there be much doubt that in terms of money income the average member of the rank and file of the Nazi movement in its early years was poorer than the average trade-unionist or member of the older socialist party—a circumstance which only gained poignancy from the fact that the former had often seen better days and were frequently still living in surroundings which were the result of this past.

[译文]
> 同样毫无疑问的是，就金钱收入而言，纳粹运动早期普通成员的平均收入比普通工会成员或老社会主义党成员的平均收入要少——这一情况因为前者常常曾经历过更好的日子、经常还生活在这段过去的结果所形成的环境中而更加令人哀伤。<!-- p10.s8 -->

[原文]
> The expression "class struggle à rebours," current in Italy at the time of the rise of fascism, did point to a very important aspect of the movement. The conflict between the Fascist or National Socialist and the older socialist parties must, indeed, very largely be regarded as the kind of conflict which is bound to arise between rival socialist factions.

[译文]
> 在法西斯主义兴起时流行于意大利的表达"反向的阶级斗争"确实指向了这一运动的一个非常重要的方面。法西斯主义或国家社会主义与老社会主义政党之间的冲突确实应该在很大程度上被视为必然会出现在对立的社会主义派系之间的那种冲突。<!-- p10.s9 -->

[原文]
> There was no difference between them about the question of its being the will of the state which should assign to each person his proper place in society. But there were, as there always will be, most profound differences about what are the proper places of the different classes and groups.

[译文]
> 在"应该由国家的意愿给每个人分配其在社会中的适当地位"这一问题上，他们之间没有分歧。但在不同阶级和群体的适当地位应该是什么这一问题上，他们有——而且总是会有——最深刻的分歧。<!-- p10.s10 -->

## 第十一节：老社会主义与新极权主义的权力交替

[原文]
> The old socialist leaders, who had always regarded their parties as the natural spearhead of the future general movement toward socialism, found it difficult to understand that with every extension in the use of socialist methods the resentment of large poor classes should turn against them. But while the old socialist parties, or the organized labor in particular industries, had usually not found it unduly difficult to come to an understanding for joint action with the employers in their particular industries, very large classes were left out in the cold. To them, and not without some justification, the more prosperous sections of the labor movement seemed to belong to the exploiting rather than to the exploited class.

[译文]
> 那些一直将自己的政党视为未来社会主义总体运动的天然先锋的老社会主义领导人，发现很难理解为什么随着社会主义方法使用范围的每次扩大，庞大贫困阶级的不满就会转向他们。但虽然老社会主义政党或特定行业的有组织劳动力通常不难与他们特定行业的雇主达成共识以进行联合行动，但很大的阶级被冷落在一边。对他们来说，并非完全没有正当理由，劳动运动中更繁荣的阶层似乎属于剥削者而非被剥削者的阶级。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> The resentment of the lower middle class, from which fascism and National Socialism recruited so large a proportion of their supporters, was intensified by the fact that their education and training had in many instances made them aspire to directing positions and that they regarded themselves as entitled to be members of the directing class. While the younger generation, out of that contempt for profit-making fostered by socialist teaching, spurned independent positions which involved risk and flocked in ever increasing numbers into salaried positions which promised security, they demanded a place yielding them the income and power to which in their opinion their training entitled them.

[译文]
> 下层中产阶级的不满——法西斯主义和国家社会主义从这个阶级招募了很大比例的支持者——因为一个事实而加剧：他们的教育和培训在许多情况下使他们渴望指导地位，而且他们认为自己有权成为指导阶级的成员。当年轻一代受到社会主义教学所培养的对营利的蔑视的影响，摒弃了涉及风险的独立职位，越来越多地涌向承诺安全的薪资职位时，他们要求获得一个能够让他们获得他们认为自己的培训所赋予他们的收入和权力的位置。<!-- p11.s2 -->

[原文]
> While they believed in an organized society, they expected a place in that society very different from that which society ruled by labor seemed to offer. They were quite ready to take over the methods of the older socialism but intended to employ them in the service of a different class. The movement was able to attract all those who, while they agreed on the desirability of the state controlling all economic activity, disagreed with the ends for which the aristocracy of the industrial workers used their political strength.

[译文]
> 虽然他们相信有组织的社会，但他们期望在那个社会中获得的地位与由劳动阶级统治的社会似乎提供的地位大不相同。他们完全准备好接管老社会主义的方法，但打算将其用于为不同阶级服务。这个运动能够吸引所有那些同意国家应该控制所有经济活动，但不同意工业工人贵族为其使用政治力量的目标的人。<!-- p11.s3 -->

---

## 第十二节：极权主义的理论优势与胜利

[原文]
> The new socialist movement started with several tactical advantages. Labor socialism had grown in a democratic and liberal world, adapting its tactics to it and taking over many of the ideals of liberalism. Its protagonists still believed that the creation of socialism as such would solve all problems. Fascism and National Socialism, on the other hand, grew out of the experience of an increasingly regulated society's awakening to the fact that democratic and international socialism was aiming at incompatible ideals.

[译文]
> 新社会主义运动带着几个战术优势开始。劳动社会主义在民主和自由的世界中成长，调整其策略以适应它，并接过了自由主义的许多理想。其倡导者仍然相信仅仅创建社会主义就能解决所有问题。另一方面，法西斯主义和国家社会主义源于越来越多地受管制的社会的经验，其社会意识到民主和国际社会主义致力于不兼容的理想。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> Their tactics were developed in a world already dominated by socialist policy and the problems it creates. They had no illusions about the possibility of a democratic solution of problems which require more agreement among people than can reasonably be expected. They had no illusions about the capacity of reason to decide all the questions of the relative importance of the wants of different men or groups which planning inevitably raises, or about the formula of equality providing an answer.

[译文]
> 他们的战术是在一个已经由社会主义政策及其造成的问题所主导的世界中发展的。他们对民主解决需要人们之间更多协议的问题的可能性毫无幻想，而这样的协议是不能合理期望的。他们对理性能够决定计划必然引发的不同人或群体想要的相对重要性的所有问题的能力毫无幻想，也对平等公式能够提供答案毫无幻想。<!-- p12.s2 -->

[原文]
> They knew that the strongest group which rallied enough supporters in favor of a new hierarchical order of society, and which frankly promised privileges to the classes to which it appealed, was likely to obtain the support of all those who were disappointed because they had been promised equality but found that they had merely furthered the interest of a particular class. Above all, they were successful because they offered a theory, or Weltanschauung, which seemed to justify the privileges they promised to their supporters.

[译文]
> 他们知道，最强大的集团若能为新的社会等级秩序集结足够的支持者，并坦诚地承诺向其吸引的阶级提供特权，就可能获得所有那些失望的人的支持——这些人曾被承诺平等，但发现他们仅仅是在促进某个特定阶级的利益。最重要的是，他们成功了是因为他们提供了一种理论或世界观，这似乎为他们承诺给支持者的特权辩护。<!-- p12.s3 -->

## 注释

### 原注

[注-原-1] Lord Acton, "The History of Freedom in Christianity," in History of Freedom and Other Essays, op. cit., p. 57.

[注-原-2] It is probable that we habitually overestimate the extent to which inequality of incomes is mainly caused by income derived from property, and therefore the extent to which the major inequalities would be abolished by abolishing income from property. What little information we have about the distribution of incomes in Soviet Russia does not suggest that the inequalities are substantially smaller there than in a capitalist society. Max Eastman, in The End of Socialism in Russia (Boston: Little, Brown, 1937), pp. 30–34, gives some information from official Russian sources which suggest that the difference between the highest and the lowest salaries paid in Russia is of the same order of magnitude (about 50 to 1) as in the United States; and Leon Trotsky, according to an article quoted by James Burnham, The Managerial Revolution: What Is Happening in the World (New York: John Day Co., 1941), p. 46, estimated as late as 1939 that "the upper 11 or 12 per cent of the Soviet population now receives approximately 50 per cent of the national income. This differentiation is sharper than in the United States, where the upper 10 per cent of the population receives approximately 35 per cent of the national income."

[注-原-3] Max Eastman, "Socialism Doesn't Jibe with Human Nature," Reader's Digest, vol. 38, June 1941, p. 47.

[注-原-4] The actual words are those of the young Disraeli: "no public avenues to wealth and honor would subsist save through the Government." It is taken from Benjamin Disraeli's essay, "Vindication of the English Constitution in a Letter to a Noble and Learned Lord" (1835).

[注-原-9] The political "book clubs" in England provide a not unimportant parallel. Balilla was the Italian Fascist organization for boys, named after the boy who started the insurrection that drove the Austrians out of Genoa in 1746. The Hitlerjugend, or Hitler Youth, was the organization for the indoctrination of the young in Germany. Dopolavoro (from dopo lavoro, Italian for "after work"), was the Italian Fascist recreational program, which included sports, cultural, and tourist events. Its German counterpart was Kraft durch Freude (Strength through Joy). Founded in 1933 within the German Labor Front and modeled after Dopolavoro, it was designed to win the working classes to National Socialism, which was particularly important after the trade unions were abolished.

[注-原-10] It is now twelve years since one of the leading European socialist intellectuals, Hendrik de Man (who has since consistently developed further and made his peace with the Nazis), observed that "for the first time since the beginning of socialism, anti-capitalist resentments are turning against the socialist movement," in Sozialismus und Nationalfascismus (Potsdam: A. Protte, 1931), p. 6. Hendrik de Man (1885–1953) was chairman of the Belgian Socialist party. When Germany invaded in 1940 he disbanded the party and declared that the destruction of parliamentary democracy under the "New Order" imposed by the Nazis would help free the working classes. He was tried and convicted in absentia of collaboration in Belgium in 1946; he spent the remainder of his days in Switzerland.

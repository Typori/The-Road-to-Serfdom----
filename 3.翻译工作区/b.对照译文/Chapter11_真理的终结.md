# The End of Truth
# 真理的终结

> 摘要：本章分析极权主义如何通过系统性地摧毁真理概念来维系控制。哈耶克阐明，为使计划经济可行，统治者必须将人民的思想转变为官方教条，进而必须控制所有信息和知识。这导致语言被掏空、事实被扭曲、科学被政治化——最终真理本身不再是需要被发现的客观事实，而是由权力机构规定的教条。这种对知识和思想的全面控制是极权主义最具毁灭性的特征。

## 第一节：思想的民族主义与信仰的强制

[原文]
> It is significant that the nationalization of thought has proceeded everywhere pari passu with the nationalization of industry.
> —E. H. Carr

[译文]
> 思想的民族主义与工业的民族主义在各地同步进行，这具有重要意义。——E. H. 卡尔<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> The most effective way of making everybody serve the single system of ends toward which the social plan is directed is to make everybody believe in those ends. To make a totalitarian system function efficiently, it is not enough that everybody should be forced to work for the same ends. It is essential that the people should come to regard them as their own ends.

[译文]
> 使每个人都为社会计划所指向的单一目标体系服务的最有效方式是使每个人都相信这些目标。要使极权体系有效运作，仅仅强制每个人为相同的目标工作是不够的。至关重要的是，人民应该开始将这些目标视为自己的目标。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> Although the beliefs must be chosen for the people and imposed upon them, they must become their beliefs, a generally accepted creed which makes the individuals as far as possible act spontaneously in the way the planner wants. If the feeling of oppression in totalitarian countries is in general much less acute than most people in liberal countries imagine, this is because the totalitarian governments succeed to a high degree in making people think as they want them to.

[译文]
> 虽然信仰必须被为人民选择和强加于他们，但它们必须变成他们的信仰——一种普遍接受的信条，使个人尽可能按计划者想要的方式自发地行动。如果极权国家中压迫感通常远不如自由国家的大多数人想象的那样尖锐，这是因为极权政府成功地使人民按他们想要的方式思考到了很大程度。<!-- p1.s3 -->

---

## 第二节：宣传的协调与思想的统一化

[原文]
> This is, of course, brought about by the various forms of propaganda. Its technique is now so familiar that we need say little about it. The only point that needs to be stressed is that neither propaganda in itself nor the techniques employed are peculiar to totalitarianism and that what so completely changes its nature and effect in a totalitarian state is that all propaganda serves the same goal—that all the instruments of propaganda are coordinated to influence the individuals in the same direction and to produce the characteristic Gleichschaltung of all minds.

[译文]
> 这当然是通过各种形式的宣传实现的。其技术现在已经如此熟悉，我们不必多说。需要强调的唯一一点是，宣传本身和所采用的技术都不是极权主义独有的，在极权国家中完全改变其性质和影响的是所有宣传都为同一目标服务——所有宣传工具都被协调为在同一方向上影响个人，并产生所有思想的特征性"齐一化"。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> As a result, the effect of propaganda in totalitarian countries is different not only in magnitude but in kind from that of the propaganda made for different ends by independent and competing agencies. If all the sources of current information are effectively under one single control, it is no longer a question of merely persuading the people of this or that. The skillful propagandist then has power to mold their minds in any direction he chooses, and even the most intelligent and independent people cannot entirely escape that influence if they are long isolated from all other sources of information.

[译文]
> 因此，极权国家中宣传的效果不仅在规模上与由独立竞争机构为不同目标进行的宣传不同，而且在种类上也不同。如果所有当前信息的源头都有效地处于单一控制下，这就不再仅仅是说服人民相信这个或那个的问题。技巧娴熟的宣传员随后有权力以他选择的任何方向塑造他们的思想，即使最聪慧和最独立的人，如果长期与所有其他信息来源隔离，也无法完全逃脱这种影响。<!-- p2.s2 -->

---

## 第三节：宣传超越价值观的深层问题

[原文]
> While in the totalitarian states this status of propaganda gives it a unique power over the minds of the people, the peculiar moral effects arise not from the technique but from the object and scope of totalitarian propaganda. If it could be confined to indoctrinating the people with the whole system of values toward which the social effort is directed, propaganda would represent merely a particular manifestation of the characteristic features of collectivist morals which we have already considered.

[译文]
> 虽然在极权国家中宣传的这种地位给了它对人民思想的独特权力，但特殊的道德影响并非源于技术而是源于极权宣传的对象和范围。如果它仅限于用社会努力指向的整个价值体系对人民进行灌输，宣传将仅仅代表我们已经考虑过的集体主义道德特征的一种特定表现。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> If its object were merely to teach the people a definite and comprehensive moral code, the problem would be solely whether this moral code is good or bad. We have seen that the moral code of a totalitarian society is not likely to appeal to us, that even the striving for equality by means of a directed economy can result only in an officially enforced inequality— an authoritarian determination of the status of each individual in the new hierarchical order—and that most of the humanitarian elements of our morals, the respect for human life, for the weak, and for the individual generally, will disappear.

[译文]
> 如果其对象仅仅是教导人民一套明确而全面的道德准则，问题将仅仅是这套道德准则是好是坏。我们已经看到，极权社会的道德准则不太可能对我们有吸引力，即使通过有向经济争取平等也只能导致官方强制的不平等——对新等级秩序中每个个人地位的专制确定——并且我们道德中的大多数人道主义元素、对人类生命的尊重、对弱者的尊重以及对个人的尊重将消失。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> However repellent this may be to most people, and though it involves a change in moral standards, it is not necessarily entirely antimoral. Some features of such a system may even appeal to the sternest moralists of a conservative tint and seem to them preferable to the softer standards of a liberal society.

[译文]
> 虽然这对大多数人来说可能令人厌恶，虽然它涉及道德标准的改变，但这不一定完全是反道德的。这样一个系统的某些特征甚至可能对最严厉的保守派道德家有吸引力，并在他们看来优于自由社会的较温和标准。<!-- p3.s3 -->

---

## 第四节：对真理本身的摧毁

[原文]
> The moral consequences of totalitarian propaganda which we must now consider are, however, of an even more profound kind. They are destructive of all morals because they undermine one of the foundations of all morals: the sense of and the respect for truth. From the nature of its task, totalitarian propaganda cannot confine itself to values, to questions of opinion and moral convictions in which the individual always will conform more or less to the views ruling his community, but must extend to questions of fact where human intelligence is involved in a different way.

[译文]
> 然而，我们现在必须考虑的极权宣传的道德后果是更深刻的。它们摧毁所有道德，因为它们破坏了所有道德的基础之一：对真理的感受和尊重。从其任务的性质来看，极权宣传不能仅限于价值观、意见问题和道德信念，个人总是会或多或少地符合其社区统治的观点，而必须扩展到人类智力以不同方式参与的事实问题。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> This is so, first, because, in order to induce people to accept the official values, these must be justified, or shown to be connected with the values already held by the people, which usually will involve assertions about causal connections between means and ends; and, second, because the distinction between ends and means, between the goal aimed at and the measures taken to achieve it, is in fact never so clear cut and definite as any general discussion of these problems is likely to suggest; and because, therefore, people must be brought to agree not only with the ultimate aims but also with the views about the facts and possibilities on which the particular measures are based.

[译文]
> 这是这样的，首先，为了诱使人民接受官方价值观，这些价值观必须被证成，或被证明与人民已经持有的价值观相联系，这通常将涉及对手段与目标之间因果关系的断言；其次，因为目标与手段之间的区分、旨在达到的目标与为实现目标而采取的措施之间的区分，事实上永远不会像任何关于这些问题的一般讨论可能建议的那样清晰和明确；因此，人民必须被说服不仅同意最终目标，而且同意有关特定措施所基于的事实和可能性的观点。<!-- p4.s2 -->

---

## 第五节：计划中隐含的价值体系

[原文]
> We have seen that agreement on that complete ethical code, that all-comprehensive system of values which is implicit in an economic plan, does not exist in a free society but would have to be created. But we must not assume that the planner will approach his task aware of that need or that, even if he were aware of it, it would be possible to create such a comprehensive code in advance. He only finds out about the conflicts between different needs as he goes along, and he has to make his decisions as the necessity arises.

[译文]
> 我们已经看到，对经济计划中隐含的完整伦理准则、全面价值体系的一致同意在自由社会中不存在，但将不得不被创造。但我们不必假定计划者会意识到这种需要而接近其任务，或者即使他意识到，也可能提前创建这样一个全面的准则。他只是在进行过程中发现不同需求之间的冲突，并且必须在必要时做出决定。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> The code of values guiding his decisions does not exist in abstracto before the decisions have to be made; it has to be created with the particular decisions. We have also seen how this inability to separate the general problem of values from the particular decisions makes it impossible that a democratic body, while unable to decide the technical details of a plan, should yet determine the values guiding it.

[译文]
> 指导其决定的价值准则在必须做决定之前不以抽象的方式存在；它必须伴随特定的决定而被创造。我们也已经看到，这种无法将价值的普遍问题与特定决定分离的无能使得民主机构不可能在无法决定计划的技术细节的同时，又确定指导它的价值观。<!-- p5.s2 -->

---

## 第六节：权力的理性化与神话的创造

[原文]
> And while the planning authority will constantly have to decide issues on merits about which there exist no definite moral rules, it will have to justify its decisions to the people—or, at least, have somehow to make the people believe that they are the right decisions. Although those responsible for a decision may have been guided by no more than prejudice, some guiding principle will have to be stated publicly if the community is not merely passively to submit but actively to support the measure.

[译文]
> 虽然计划当局将必须不断就不存在明确道德规则的问题根据其价值判断决策，但它将不得不向人民证明其决定的正当性——或至少以某种方式使人民相信这些是正确的决定。虽然对决定负责的人可能只是由偏见引导，但如果社区不仅仅是被动地服从而是积极地支持该措施，某种指导原则将不得不被公开陈述。<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> The need to rationalize the likes and dislikes which, for lack of anything else, must guide the planner in many of his decisions, and the necessity of stating his reasons in a form in which they will appeal to as many people as possible, will force him to construct theories, i.e., assertions about the connections between facts, which then become an integral part of the governing doctrine.

[译文]
> 需要为计划者在许多决定中必须引导的好恶进行理性化的必要性，因为缺乏其他东西，以及以吸引尽可能多的人的形式陈述其原因的必要性，将强制他构造理论，即关于事实之间联系的断言，这些随后成为统治教条的组成部分。<!-- p6.s2 -->

---

## 第七节：神话的无意识产生

[原文]
> This process of creating a "myth" to justify his action need not be conscious. The totalitarian leader may be guided merely by an instinctive dislike of the state of things he has found and a desire to create a new hierarchical order which conforms better to his conception of merit; he may merely know that he dislikes the Jews who seemed to be so successful in an order which did not provide a satisfactory place for him, and that he loves and admires the tall blond man, the "aristocratic" figure of the novels of his youth.

[译文]
> 创造一个"神话"来为其行为辩护的这个过程不一定是有意识的。极权领导者可能仅仅被对他所发现的事物状态的本能厌恶以及创建一个更符合其功绩观的新等级秩序的欲望所引导；他可能仅仅知道他不喜欢那些在一个没有为他提供令人满意位置的秩序中似乎非常成功的犹太人，而且他喜爱和钦佩高大的金发男人、他青年小说中的"贵族"形象。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> So he will readily embrace theories which seem to provide a rational justification for the prejudices which he shares with many of his fellows. Thus a pseudoscientific theory becomes part of the official creed which to a greater or lesser degree directs everybody's action. Or the widespread dislike of the industrial civilization and a romantic yearning for country life, together with a (probably erroneous) idea about the special value of country people as soldiers, provide the basis for another myth: Blut und Boden ("blood and soil"), expressing not merely ultimate values but a whole host of beliefs about cause and effect which, once they have become ideals directing the activity of the whole community, must not be questioned.

[译文]
> 因此他将欣然接纳那些似乎为他与许多同伴所共有的偏见提供合理证明的理论。因此，一个伪科学理论成为官方信条的一部分，在或多或少的程度上指导每个人的行动。或者，对工业文明的广泛厌恶和对乡村生活的浪漫渴望，加上关于乡村人民作为士兵的特殊价值的（可能是错误的）想法，为另一个神话提供了基础："血与土"，表达的不仅仅是最终价值，而是大量关于因果关系的信念，一旦它们成为指导整个社区活动的理想，就不能被质疑。<!-- p7.s2 -->

---

## 第八节：官方教条与科学理论化

[原文]
> The need for such official doctrines as an instrument of directing and rallying the efforts of the people has been clearly foreseen by the various theoreticians of the totalitarian system. Plato's "noble lies" and Sorel's "myths" serve the same purpose as the racial doctrine of the Nazis or the theory of the corporative state of Mussolini. They are all necessarily based on particular views about facts which are then elaborated into scientific theories in order to justify a preconceived opinion.

[译文]
> 各种极权主义理论家明确预见了需要这样的官方教条作为指导和鼓舞人民努力的工具。柏拉图的"高贵的谎言"和索雷尔的"神话"与纳粹的种族教条或墨索里尼的法团国家理论起相同的作用。它们都必然基于关于事实的特定观点，这些观点随后被精心发展成科学理论以证明先入为主的观点。<!-- p8.s1 -->

---

## 第九节：旧词新义的语言颠覆

[原文]
> The most effective way of making people accept the validity of the values they are to serve is to persuade them that they are really the same as those which they, or at least the best among them, have always held, but which were not properly understood or recognized before. The people are made to transfer their allegiance from the old gods to the new under the pretense that the new gods really are what their sound instinct had always told them but what before they had only dimly seen.

[译文]
> 使人们接受他们要为之服务的价值观的有效性的最有效方式是说服他们，这些价值观确实与他们或至少其中最好的人一直所持有的价值观相同，只是之前没有被正确理解或认可。人民被要求在新的诸神真的是他们的健全直觉一直告诉他们但他们之前仅仅模糊地看到的东西的借口下，从对旧诸神的忠诚转向对新诸神的忠诚。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> And the most efficient technique to this end is to use the old words but change their meaning. Few traits of totalitarian regimes are at the same time so confusing to the superficial observer and yet so characteristic of the whole intellectual climate as the complete perversion of language, the change of meaning of the words by which the ideals of the new regimes are expressed.

[译文]
> 实现这一目标的最有效技术是使用旧词但改变其含义。极权制度中很少有特征同时对表面观察者如此混淆，但又如此典型地体现整个知识氛围的，就像语言的完全颠覆、用以表达新制度理想的词语含义的改变。<!-- p9.s2 -->

---

## 第十节：自由一词的倒转

[原文]
> The worst sufferer in this respect is, of course, the word "liberty." It is a word used as freely in totalitarian states as elsewhere. Indeed, it could almost be said—and it should serve as a warning to us to be on our guard against all the tempters who promise us New Liberties for Old—that wherever liberty as we understand it has been destroyed, this has almost always been done in the name of some new freedom promised to the people.

[译文]
> 在这方面最大的受害者当然是"自由"这个词。它在极权国家中的使用频率与其他地方一样高。实际上，几乎可以说——这应该是对我们的警告，让我们提防所有承诺给我们"新自由换旧自由"的诱惑者——无论我们理解的自由在哪里被摧毁，这几乎总是以对人民承诺某种新的自由的名义进行的。<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> Even among us we have "planners for freedom" who promise us a "collective freedom for the group," the nature of which may be gathered from the fact that its advocate finds it necessary to assure us that "naturally the advent of planned freedom does not mean that all [sic] earlier forms of freedom must be abolished." Dr. Karl Mannheim, from whose work these sentences are taken, at least warns us that "a conception of freedom modelled on the preceding age is an obstacle to any real understanding of the problem." But his use of the word "freedom" is as misleading as it is in the mouth of totalitarian politicians.

[译文]
> 即使在我们当中，我们也有"为自由而计划的计划者"，他们承诺给我们"为群体的集体自由"，其性质可以从其倡导者觉得有必要向我们保证"自然，计划自由的到来并不意味着所有早期形式的自由都必须被废除"这一事实中看出。卡尔·曼海姆博士，从其著作中取材的这些句子的作者，至少警告我们"以先前时代为模式的自由观是对问题任何真实理解的障碍。"但他对"自由"这个词的使用就像在极权政治家口中一样具有误导性。<!-- p10.s2 -->

[原文]
> Like their freedom, the "collective freedom" he offers us is not the freedom of the members of society but the unlimited freedom of the planner to do with society what he pleases. It is the confusion of freedom with power carried to the extreme.

[译文]
> 像他们的自由一样，他提供给我们的"集体自由"不是社会成员的自由，而是计划者以他高兴的方式处理社会的无限自由。这是将自由与权力混淆发展到极端。<!-- p10.s3 -->

---

## 第十一节：语言颠覆的扩展

[原文]
> In this particular case the perversion of the meaning of the word has, of course, been well prepared by a long line of German philosophers and, not least, by many of the theoreticians of socialism. But "freedom" or "liberty" are by no means the only words whose meaning has been changed into their opposites to make them serve as instruments of totalitarian propaganda. We have already seen how the same happens to "justice" and "law," "right" and "equality." The list could be extended until it includes almost all moral and political terms in general use.

[译文]
> 当然，这个特定的词义颠覆已经由一长列德国哲学家精心准备，尤其是许多社会主义理论家。但"自由"或"自由"绝非唯一含义已被改变为其相反以充当极权宣传工具的词。我们已经看到"正义"和"法律"、"权利"和"平等"也发生了同样的情况。这个清单可以扩展到包括几乎所有常用的道德和政治术语。<!-- p11.s1 -->

---

## 第十二节：语言改变的深层影响

[原文]
> If one has not one's self experienced this process, it is difficult to appreciate the magnitude of this change of the meaning of words, the confusion which it causes, and the barriers to any rational discussion which it creates. It has to be seen to be understood how, if one of two brothers embraces the new faith, after a short while he appears to speak a different language which makes any real communication between them impossible.

[译文]
> 如果一个人自己没有经历过这个过程，就很难理解词义变化的规模、它造成的混淆以及它对任何理性讨论造成的障碍。必须亲眼所见才能理解，如果两兄弟中的一个接受新信仰，不久之后他似乎开始说一种不同的语言，使他们之间任何真实的沟通都成为不可能。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> And the confusion becomes worse because this change of meaning of the words describing political ideals is not a single event but a continuous process, a technique employed consciously or unconsciously to direct the people. Gradually, as this process continues, the whole language becomes despoiled, and words become empty shells deprived of any definite meaning, as capable of denoting one thing as its opposite and used solely for the emotional associations which still adhere to them.

[译文]
> 混淆变得更糟，因为描述政治理想的词义改变不是一个单一事件而是一个持续的过程，一种有意识或无意识地用来指导人民的技术。随着这个过程的继续，整个语言逐渐被摧毁，词语变成了空壳，被剥夺了任何明确的含义，既能表示一个事物也能表示其相反的东西，仅仅被用于仍然附着于它们的情感关联。<!-- p12.s2 -->

---

## 第十三节：批评的压制与事实的神圣化

[原文]
> It is not difficult to deprive the great majority of independent thought. But the minority who will retain an inclination to criticize must also be silenced. We have already seen why coercion cannot be confined to the acceptance of the ethical code underlying the plan according to which all social activity is directed. Since many parts of this code will never be explicitly stated, since many parts of the guiding scale of values will exist only implicitly in the plan, the plan itself in every detail, in fact every act of the government, must become sacrosanct and exempt from criticism.

[译文]
> 剥夺绝大多数人的独立思考并不困难。但那些将保留批评倾向的少数人也必须被沉默。我们已经看到为什么强制不能仅限于接受据以指导所有社会活动的计划所基于的伦理准则。由于这个准则的许多部分永远不会被明确表述，由于指导价值标度的许多部分将仅仅隐含地存在于计划中，计划本身的每个细节、实际上政府的每个行为，都必须变得神圣不可侵犯和免于批评。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> If the people are to support the common effort without hesitation, they must be convinced that not only the end aimed at but also the means chosen are the right ones. The official creed, to which adherence must be enforced, will therefore comprise all the views about facts on which the plan is based. Public criticism or even expressions of doubt must be suppressed because they tend to weaken public support.

[译文]
> 如果人民要毫不犹豫地支持共同努力，他们必须确信不仅目标是正确的，选择的手段也是正确的。因此，必须被强行执行信仰的官方信条将包括计划所基于的所有关于事实的观点。必须压制公开批评甚至对怀疑的表达，因为它们倾向于削弱公众支持。<!-- p13.s2 -->

[原文]
> As the Webbs report of the position in every Russian enterprise: "Whilst the work is in progress, any public expression of doubt, or even fear that the plan will not be successful, is an act of disloyalty and even of treachery because of its possible effects on the will and on the efforts of the rest of the staff." When the doubt or fear expressed concerns not the success of a particular enterprise but of the whole social plan, it must be treated even more as sabotage.

[译文]
> 如韦比夫妇报告的每个俄罗斯企业中的状况所示："在工作进行中，对计划是否会成功的任何公开表达怀疑，甚至恐惧，由于其对其他员工的意志和努力的可能影响，这是一种不忠诚甚至背叛的行为。"当所表达的怀疑或恐惧不是关乎特定企业的成功而是关乎整个社会计划的成功时，它必须被更当作破坏活动来对待。<!-- p13.s3 -->

---

## 第十四节：信息控制与知识垄断

[原文]
> Facts and theories must thus become no less the object of an official doctrine than views about values. And the whole apparatus for spreading knowledge— the schools and the press, radio and motion picture—will be used exclusively to spread those views which, whether true or false, will strengthen the belief in the rightness of the decisions taken by the authority; and all information that might cause doubt or hesitation will be withheld.

[译文]
> 因此，事实和理论必须不少于关于价值观的观点成为官方教条的对象。而传播知识的整个机制——学校和新闻、广播和电影——将被专门用来传播那些观点，无论真假，都将加强对权力所做决定的正确性的信念；所有可能造成怀疑或犹豫的信息将被扣留。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> The probable effect on the people's loyalty to the system becomes the only criterion for deciding whether a particular piece of information is to be published or suppressed. The situation in a totalitarian state is permanently and in all fields the same that it is elsewhere in some fields in wartime. Everything which might cause doubt about the wisdom of the government or create discontent will be kept from the people.

[译文]
> 对人民对体系的忠诚的可能影响成为决定是否发表或压制特定信息的唯一标准。极权国家中的状况在所有领域中都是永久的，与在其他地方战时在某些领域中的状况相同。任何可能导致对政府智慧的怀疑或制造不满的东西都将对人民保密。<!-- p14.s2 -->

[原文]
> The basis of unfavorable comparisons with conditions elsewhere, the knowledge of possible alternatives to the course actually taken, information which might suggest failure on the part of the government to live up to its promises or to take advantage of opportunities to improve conditions—all will be suppressed. There is consequently no field where the systematic control of information will not be practiced and uniformity of views not enforced.

[译文]
> 与其他地方条件进行不利比较的基础、关于实际采取的路线的可能替代方案的知识、可能表明政府在实践承诺或利用改善条件机会方面失败的信息——所有这些都将被压制。因此，没有任何领域信息的系统控制不会被实践，观点的一致性不会被强制。<!-- p14.s3 -->

---

## 第十五节：科学的政治化与抽象思维的压制

[原文]
> This applies even to fields apparently most remote from any political interests and particularly to all the sciences, even the most abstract. That in the disciplines dealing directly with human affairs and therefore most immediately affecting political views, such as history, law, or economics, the disinterested search for truth cannot be allowed in a totalitarian system, and the vindication of the official views becomes the sole object, is easily seen and has been amply confirmed by experience.

[译文]
> 这甚至适用于显然最远离任何政治利益的领域，尤其是所有科学，甚至最抽象的科学。在直接处理人类事务、因此最直接影响政治观点的学科中，如历史、法律或经济学，极权体系中不能允许进行无利益的真理搜寻，官方观点的证实变成唯一的对象，这很容易看到，并已被经验充分证实。<!-- p15.s1 -->

[原文]
> These disciplines have, indeed, in all totalitarian countries become the most fertile factories of the official myths which the rulers use to guide the minds and wills of their subjects. It is not surprising that in these spheres even the pretense that they search for truth is abandoned and that the authorities decide what doctrines ought to be taught and published.

[译文]
> 这些学科确实在所有极权国家中都成了统治者用来指导其臣民的思想和意志的官方神话最肥沃的工厂。在这些领域中，甚至关于他们搜寻真理的伪装都被放弃，权力机构决定应该教授和发表什么教义，这并不令人惊讶。<!-- p15.s2 -->

---

## 第十六节：抽象科学的党派性

[原文]
> Totalitarian control of opinion extends, however, also to subjects which at first seem to have no political significance. Sometimes it is difficult to explain why particular doctrines should be officially proscribed or why others should be encouraged, and it is curious that these likes and dislikes are apparently somewhat similar in the different totalitarian systems. In particular, they all seem to have in common an intense dislike of the more abstract forms of thought—a dislike characteristically also shown by many of the collectivists among our scientists.

[译文]
> 然而，极权对舆论的控制也扩展到乍一看似乎没有政治意义的主题。有时很难解释为什么特定的教义应该被官方禁止或为什么其他教义应该被鼓励，而且好奇的是，这些好恶在不同极权体系中似乎大致相似。特别是，它们似乎都有一个共同点：对更抽象的思想形式的强烈厌恶——这种厌恶也很有特点地被我们科学家中的许多集体主义者表现出来。<!-- p16.s1 -->

[原文]
> Whether the theory of relativity is represented as a "Semitic attack on the foundation of Christian and Nordic physics" or opposed because it is "in conflict with dialectical materialism and Marxist dogma" comes very much to the same thing. Nor does it make much difference whether certain theorems of mathematical statistics are attacked because they "form part of the class struggle on the ideological frontier and are a product of the historical role of mathematics as the servant of the bourgeoisie," or whether the whole subject is condemned because "it provides no guaranty that it will serve the interest of the people."

[译文]
> 无论相对论理论是被代表为"对基督教和北欧物理学基础的闪米特攻击"还是因为"与辩证唯物主义和马克思主义教条相冲突"而被反对，基本上是一回事。也没有太大区别，数学统计学的某些定理是因为"形成意识形态前沿的阶级斗争的一部分，是数学作为资产阶级仆人的历史角色的产物"而被攻击，还是整个学科因为"它没有提供保证它将服务于人民的利益"而被谴责。<!-- p16.s2 -->

[原文]
> It seems that pure mathematics is no less a victim and that even the holding of particular views about the nature of continuity can be ascribed to "bourgeois prejudices." According to the Webbs, the Journal for Marxist-Leninist Natural Sciences has the following slogans: "We stand for Party in Mathematics. We stand for the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory in surgery." The situation seems to be very similar in Germany. The Journal of the National-Socialist Association of Mathematicians is full of "party in mathematics," and one of the best-known German physicists, the Nobel prizeman Lenard, has summed up his lifework under the title German Physics in Four Volumes!

[译文]
> 似乎纯数学同样是受害者，甚至持有关于连续性本质的特定观点也可以归咎于"资产阶级偏见"。根据韦比夫妇的说法，《马克思列宁主义自然科学杂志》有以下标语："我们在数学中主张党性。我们在外科学中主张马克思列宁主义理论的纯粹性。"德国的情况似乎非常相似。《国家社会主义数学家协会杂志》充满了"数学中的党性"，一位著名的德国物理学家、诺贝尔奖得主伦纳特已经将他的终身工作概括为《四卷本的德国物理学》的标题！<!-- p16.s3 -->

---

## 第十七节：目的性思维的强制

[原文]
> It is entirely in keeping with the whole spirit of totalitarianism that it condemns any human activity done for its own sake and without ulterior purpose. Science for science's sake, art for art's sake, are equally abhorrent to the Nazis, our socialist intellectuals, and the communists. Every activity must derive its justification from a conscious social purpose. There must be no spontaneous, unguided activity, because it might produce results which cannot be foreseen and for which the plan does not provide.

[译文]
> 极权主义谴责任何为自身而做且没有隐秘目的的人类活动，这完全符合极权主义的整个精神。"为科学而科学"、"为艺术而艺术"，对纳粹、我们的社会主义知识分子和共产主义者来说都是同样令人厌恶的。每项活动都必须从有意识的社会目的中获得其理由。不能有自发的、无导向的活动，因为它可能产生无法预见的、计划不能预见的结果。<!-- p17.s1 -->

[原文]
> It might produce something new, undreamed of in the philosophy of the planner. The principle extends even to games and amusements. I leave it to the reader to guess whether it was in Germany or in Russia that chess-players were officially exhorted that "we must finish once and for all with the neutrality of chess. We must condemn once and for all the formula 'chess for the sake of chess' like the formula 'art for art's sake.'"

[译文]
> 它可能产生计划者哲学中从未梦想过的新东西。这个原则甚至扩展到游戏和娱乐。我让读者猜测是在德国还是在俄罗斯，国际象棋运动员被官方劝告"我们必须一劳永逸地终止国际象棋的中立性。我们必须一劳永逸地谴责'为了国际象棋而下棋'的公式，就像'为艺术而艺术'的公式一样。"<!-- p17.s2 -->

## 第十八节：偏差的必然性与系统特征

[原文]
> Incredible as some of these aberrations may appear, we must yet be on our guard not to dismiss them as mere accidental by-products which have nothing to do with the essential character of a planned or totalitarian system. They are not. They are a direct result of that same desire to see everything directed by a "unitary conception of the whole," of the need to uphold at all costs the views in the service of which people are asked to make constant sacrifices, and of the general idea that the knowledge and beliefs of the people are an instrument to be used for a single purpose.

[译文]
> 虽然这些怪诞现象中的一些看起来不可思议，但我们必须警惕不要将它们视为仅仅是与计划或极权体系的基本特征无关的偶然副产品。它们不是。它们是对所有事情都应由"整体的统一观念"指导的相同欲望、需要不惜一切代价维持要求人民做出持续牺牲的观点的需要，以及人民的知识和信仰是应该为单一目的而使用的工具的一般理念的直接结果。<!-- p18.s1 -->

[原文]
> Once science has to serve, not truth, but the interests of a class, a community, or a state, the sole task of argument and discussion is to vindicate and to spread still further the beliefs by which the whole life of the community is directed. As the Nazi minister of justice has explained, the question which every new scientific theory must ask itself is: "Do I serve National Socialism for the greatest benefit of all?"

[译文]
> 一旦科学必须为阶级、社区或国家的利益服务，而不是为真理服务，论证和讨论的唯一任务就是证实和进一步传播指导社区整个生活的信念。如纳粹司法部长所解释的，每个新的科学理论必须问自己的问题是："我是否为了最大多数人的利益而为国家社会主义服务？"<!-- p18.s2 -->

---

## 第十九节：真理的重新定义

[原文]
> The word "truth" itself ceases to have its old meaning. It describes no longer something to be found, with the individual conscience as the sole arbiter of whether in any particular instance the evidence (or the standing of those proclaiming it) warrants a belief; it becomes something to be laid down by authority, something which has to be believed in the interest of the unity of the organized effort and which may have to be altered as the exigencies of this organized effort require it.

[译文]
> "真理"这个词本身停止了其旧含义。它不再描述要被找到的某样东西，个人良心是在任何特定情况下证据（或宣告者的地位）是否值得相信的唯一仲裁者；它变成了由权力机构规定的某样东西，必须被相信是为了有组织的努力的统一的利益，并且可能必须按照有组织的努力的紧急情况所需而改变。<!-- p19.s1 -->

---

## 第二十节：思想气候的腐蚀

[原文]
> The general intellectual climate which this produces, the spirit of complete cynicism as regards truth which it engenders, the loss of the sense of even the meaning of truth, the disappearance of the spirit of independent inquiry and of the belief in the power of rational conviction, the way in which differences of opinion in every branch of knowledge become political issues to be decided by authority, are all things which one must personally experience—no short description can convey their extent.

[译文]
> 这产生的一般知识氛围、它所引发的关于真理的完全虚伪精神、甚至对真理含义的感觉丧失、独立探究精神和对理性信念力量的信仰的消失、每个知识分支中的意见分歧如何变成由权力机构决定的政治问题，这些都是必须亲身经历的事情——没有简短的描述能够传达其范围。<!-- p20.s1 -->

[原文]
> Perhaps the most alarming fact is that contempt for intellectual liberty is not a thing which arises only once the totalitarian system is established but one which can be found everywhere among intellectuals who have embraced a collectivist faith and who are acclaimed as intellectual leaders even in countries still under a liberal regime.

[译文]
> 也许最令人震惊的事实是，对知识自由的蔑视不是仅仅在极权体系建立后才出现的东西，而是可以在四处受到已经接受集体主义信仰并被誉为即使在仍在自由制度下的国家的知识领袖的知识分子之中发现。<!-- p20.s2 -->

---

## 第二十一节：西方知识分子的威胁

[原文]
> Not only is even the worst oppression condoned if it is committed in the name of socialism, and the creation of a totalitarian system openly advocated by people who pretend to speak for the scientists of liberal countries; intolerance, too, is openly extolled. Have we not recently seen a British scientific writer defend even Inquisition because in his opinion it "is beneficial to science when it protects a rising class"? This view is, of course, practically indistinguishable from the views which led the Nazis to the persecution of men of science, the burning of scientific books, and the systematic eradication of the intelligentsia of the subjected people.

[译文]
> 不仅即使是最坏的压迫如果是以社会主义的名义进行的也会被宽恕，而且极权体系的创建被假装代表自由国家的科学家的人公开提倡；不宽容也被公开颂扬。我们最近没有看到一个英国科学作家甚至为宗教法庭辩护，因为他认为"当它保护一个新兴阶级时，它对科学是有益的"吗？这种观点当然与导致纳粹迫害科学家、焚烧科学书籍和系统根除被征服民族知识分子的观点几乎没有区别。<!-- p21.s1 -->

---

## 第二十二节：虚假的"无思想自由"论证

[原文]
> The desire to force upon the people a creed which is regarded as salutary for them is, of course, not a thing that is new or peculiar to our time. New, however, is the argument by which many of our intellectuals try to justify such attempts. There is no real freedom of thought in our society, so it is said, because the opinions and tastes of the masses are shaped by propaganda, by advertising, by the example of the upper classes, and by other environmental factors which inevitably force the thinking of the people into well-worn grooves.

[译文]
> 将被视为对人民有益的信条强加于他们的欲望当然不是新的或特别属于我们这个时代的东西。然而新的是许多知识分子试图为这样的尝试辩护的论证。据说，我们社会中没有真正的思想自由，因为群众的意见和品味是由宣传、广告、上层阶级的榜样和其他不可避免地强制人民思想陷入已有的沟槽的环境因素塑造的。<!-- p22.s1 -->

[原文]
> From this it is concluded that if the ideals and tastes of the great majority are always fashioned by circumstances which we can control, we ought to use this power deliberately to turn the thoughts of the people in what we think is a desirable direction.

[译文]
> 从这一点得出结论，如果大多数人的理想和品味总是由我们能够控制的情况塑造的，我们应该故意使用这种权力将人民的思想转向我们认为是理想方向的方向。<!-- p22.s2 -->

---

## 第二十三节：独立思维的真正意义

[原文]
> Probably it is true enough that the great majority are rarely capable of thinking independently, that on most questions they accept views which they find ready-made, and that they will be equally content if born or coaxed into one set of beliefs or another. In any society freedom of thought will probably be of direct significance only for a small minority. But this does not mean that anyone is competent, or ought to have power, to select those to whom this freedom is to be reserved.

[译文]
> 可能足够真实的是，绝大多数人很少能够独立思考，在大多数问题上他们接受他们发现的现成观点，如果出生或被诱导进入一套信念或另一套信念，他们会同样满足。在任何社会中，思想自由可能仅对少数人具有直接意义。但这并不意味着任何人都有能力或应该拥有权力选择这种自由应该被保留给谁。<!-- p23.s1 -->

[原文]
> It certainly does not justify the presumption of any group of people to claim the right to determine what people ought to think or believe. It shows a complete confusion of thought to suggest that, because under any sort of system the majority of people follow the lead of somebody, it makes no difference if everybody has to follow the same lead.

[译文]
> 这当然不能为任何一组人声称确定人们应该思考或相信什么的权利的傲慢辩护。暗示，因为在任何体系下大多数人都跟随某人的领导，如果每个人都必须跟随同一个领导，那就没有区别，这显示了完全的思想混淆。<!-- p23.s2 -->

[原文]
> To deprecate the value of intellectual freedom because it will never mean for everybody the same possibility of independent thought is completely to miss the reasons which give intellectual freedom its value. What is essential to make it serve its function as the prime mover of intellectual progress is not that everybody may be able to think or write anything but that any cause or idea may be argued by somebody.

[译文]
> 因为它永远不会为每个人意味着独立思考的同样可能性而贬低知识自由的价值是完全错过了给知识自由其价值的原因。要使其作为知识进步的第一推动力发挥其功能至关重要的是，不是每个人都可能能够思考或写任何东西，而是任何事业或想法都可能被某人论证。<!-- p23.s3 -->

---

## 第二十四节：思想的社会过程

[原文]
> So long as dissent is not suppressed, there will always be some who will query the ideas ruling their contemporaries and put new ideas to the test of argument and propaganda. This interaction of individuals, possessing different knowledge and different views, is what constitutes the life of thought. The growth of reason is a social process based on the existence of such differences.

[译文]
> 只要异议不被压制，总会有一些人会质疑统治他们同代人的想法，并将新想法付诸论证和宣传的测试。具有不同知识和不同观点的个人之间的这种相互作用构成了思想的生活。理性的增长是基于这种差异存在的社会过程。<!-- p24.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is of its essence that its results cannot be predicted, that we cannot know which views will assist this growth and which will not—in short, that this growth cannot be governed by any views which we now possess without at the same time limiting it. To "plan" or "organize" the growth of mind, or, for that matter, progress in general, is a contradiction in terms.

[译文]
> 其本质是其结果无法预测，我们不能知道哪些观点将辅助这种增长，哪些不会——简言之，这种增长不能由我们现在持有的任何观点来管理，而不同时限制它。"计划"或"组织"思想的增长，或就此而言，一般的进步，是术语上的矛盾。<!-- p24.s2 -->

---

## 第二十五节：理性的发展与专制的悖论

[原文]
> The idea that the human mind ought "consciously" to control its own development confuses individual reason, which alone can "consciously control" anything, with the interpersonal process to which its growth is due. By attempting to control it, we are merely setting bounds to its development and must sooner or later produce a stagnation of thought and a decline of reason.

[译文]
> 人类思想应该"有意识地"控制自己发展的想法混淆了个人理性（唯一能够"有意识地控制"任何东西的）与其增长所来源的人际过程。通过尝试控制它，我们仅仅是为其发展设置界限，迟早必须产生思想停滞和理性衰退。<!-- p25.s1 -->

---

## 第二十六节：集体主义思想的悖论

[原文]
> The tragedy of collectivist thought is that, while it starts out to make reason supreme, it ends by destroying reason because it misconceives the process on which the growth of reason depends. It may indeed be said that it is the paradox of all collectivist doctrine and its demand for "conscious" control or "conscious" planning that they necessarily lead to the demand that the mind of some individual should rule supreme—while only the individualist approach to social phenomena makes us recognize the superindividual forces which guide the growth of reason.

[译文]
> 集体主义思想的悲剧是，虽然它开始时试图使理性至高无上，但最后通过误解理性增长所依赖的过程而摧毁理性。可以确实说，所有集体主义教条及其对"有意识"控制或"有意识"计划的要求的悖论在于，它们必然导致某个个人的思想应该至高无上的要求——而仅仅是对社会现象的个人主义方法使我们认识到指导理性增长的超个人力量。<!-- p26.s1 -->

[原文]
> Individualism is thus an attitude of humility before this social process and of tolerance to other opinions and is the exact opposite of that intellectual hubris which is at the root of the demand for comprehensive direction of the social process.

[译文]
> 因此，个人主义是对这个社会过程的谦虚态度和对其他观点的容忍，恰好与对社会过程综合方向的要求根源的知识傲慢相反。<!-- p26.s2 -->

## 注释

### 原注

[注-原-1] E. H. Carr, The Twenty Years' Crisis, op. cit., p. 172. Carr actually uses the term "nationalization of opinion," rather than "nationalization of thought."

[注-原-2] Gleichschaltung is usually translated as "coordination," and is the term used to describe the Nazis' efforts to coordinate all political, economic, cultural, and even recreational activities in support of the state. The forced reorganization of the disparate trade unions into a single labor "front" is a standard example.

[注-原-3] Blut und Boden, a term first introduced by the historian Oswald Spengler, was the doctrine that the state rightly consists of people of a uniform race on their own land. The Nazis used it to justify a number of changes in agricultural policy, including the seizure of the land of non-Germans and the institution of the Hereditary Farm Law, which was meant to preserve an exclusively German peasantry as a source of bloodlines for the German Volk.

[注-原-4] Plato's "noble lies" refers to the lies that the leaders of a republic must tell to get each person to fulfill the function that the leaders thought best suited his nature, thereby ensuring a stable society. The French philosopher Georges Sorel (1847–1922) argued that to be successful political opposition must use violence, and that "social myths" are necessary to inspire the necessary collective action.

[注-原-5] This is the title of a recent work by the historian Carl L. Becker. Hayek refers to Carl Becker, New Liberties for Old (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1941).

[注-原-6] Karl Mannheim, Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction, op. cit., p. 379. (Hayek incorrectly listed the quotation from Mannheim as appearing on p. 377.)

[注-原-7] Peter Drucker, The End of Economic Man, op. cit., p. 74, correctly observes that "the less freedom there is, the more there is talk of the 'new freedom.' Yet this new freedom is a mere word which covers the exact contradiction of all that Europe ever understood by freedom. . . . The new freedom which is preached in Europe is, however, the right of the majority against the individual."

[注-原-8] Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Soviet Communism: A New Civilization? op. cit., vol. 2, p. 1038.

[注-原-9] Ibid., p. 1000.

[注-原-10] The German physicist Philipp von Lenard (1862–1947) made a number of contributions to experimental physics, and under the Nazis held the title of Chief of German Physics. The four-volume work to which Hayek refers is Deutsche Physik in Vier Bänden (Munich: J. F. Lehmann, 1936–1937).

[注-原-11] The speaker was Nikolai V. Krylenko, the People's Commissar for Justice, and he said this at a 1932 congress of chess players. The quotation is cited in full in Boris Souvarine, Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism, translated by C. L. R. James (London: Alliance, 1939; reprinted, New York: Octagon, 1972), p. 575.

[注-原-12] Franz Gurtner was the Nazi Minister of Justice from 1933 through 1941. Franz Schlegel-berger followed as Acting Minister, and Otto Georg Thierack served as Minister from 1942 to 1945. It is not clear which one is responsible for the statement in the text.

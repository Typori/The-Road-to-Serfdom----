## 第一节：历史岔路——十九世纪自由主义的兴衰

[原文]
> When the course of civilization takes an unexpected turn—when, instead of the continuous progress which we have come to expect, we find ourselves threatened by evils associated by us with past ages of barbarism—we naturally blame anything but ourselves. <!-- p1.s1 -->

[译文]
> 当文明的进程意外转折时——当我们预期的持续进步戛然而止，反而被那些我们以为早已摆脱的"野蛮时代"的恶兆所威胁时——我们自然而然地会把责任推给别人，唯独不愿反思自己。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> Have we not all striven according to our best lights, and have not many of our finest minds incessantly worked to make this a better world? Have not all our efforts and hopes been directed toward greater freedom, justice, and prosperity? <!-- p1.s2 -->

[译文]
> 我们难道不是都在按照自己最好的理解而努力吗？我们当中许多杰出人物难道不是一直在不懈地工作，试图让这个世界变得更美好吗？我们的所有努力和希望，难道不都指向了更大的自由、正义和繁荣吗？<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> If the outcome is so different from our aims—if, instead of freedom and prosperity, bondage and misery stare us in the face—is it not clear that sinister forces must have foiled our intentions, that we are the victims of some evil power which must be conquered before we can resume the road to better things? <!-- p1.s3 -->

[译文]
> 然而结果却截然不同——我们面对的不是自由和繁荣，而是奴役和苦难。那么难道不是显而易见：一定有某种邪恶力量挫败了我们的意图？难道我们不是某种恶势力的受害者，必须先战胜这股力量才能重新走上通往美好事物的道路吗？<!-- p1.s3 -->

[原文]
> However much we may differ when we name the culprit—whether it is the wicked capitalist or the vicious spirit of a particular nation, the stupidity of our elders, or a social system not yet, although we have struggled against it for half a century, fully overthrown—we all are, or at last were until recently, certain of one thing: that the leading ideas which during the last generation have become common to most people of good will and have determined the major changes in our social life cannot have been wrong. <!-- p1.s4 -->

[译文]
> 虽然我们在指认罪魁祸首时众说纷纭——有人怪罪贪婪的资本家，有人指责某民族的恶毒精神，有人批评长辈的愚蠢，还有人声称那个我们已经斗争了半个世纪却仍未彻底推翻的社会制度才是祸根——但直到最近为止，我们所有人都坚信一点：过去这一代人中，那些已被大多数善良人士所接受、并决定了我们社会生活重大变革的主导思想，绝不可能是错的。<!-- p1.s4 -->

[原文]
> We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis of our civilization except one: that the present state of the world may be the result of genuine error on our own part and that the pursuit of some of our most cherished ideals has apparently produced results utterly different from those which we expected. <!-- p1.s5 -->

[译文]
> 对于我们文明当前的危机，我们愿意接受几乎任何解释——除了一个：我们自己曾经真心实意地犯了一个错误，而我们对某些最珍视的理想的追求，反而产生了完全相反的后果。这一点，我们至今还不愿承认。<!-- p1.s5 -->

[原文]
> While all our energies are directed to bring this war to a victorious conclusion, it is sometimes difficult to remember that even before the war the values for which we are now fighting were threatened here and destroyed elsewhere. <!-- p2.s1 -->

[译文]
> 当我们全力以赴赢得这场战争时，我们很容易忘记一个事实：在战争爆发前，我们现在为之战斗的那些价值观就已经在这里遭到威胁[注-译-1]，在别处被彻底摧毁了[注-译-2]。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> Though for the time being the different ideals are represented by hostile nations fighting for their existence, we must not forget that this conflict has grown out of a struggle of ideas within what, not so long ago, was a common European civilization and that the tendencies which have culminated in the creation of the totalitarian systems were not confined to the countries which have succumbed to them. <!-- p2.s2 -->

[译文]
> 眼下这些对立的理想确实由敌对的国家所代表，它们为了生存而战。但我们不能忘记这样一个事实：这场冲突源于欧洲文明内部的思想斗争——而这个欧洲文明，不久前还是统一的。那些最终导致极权主义体制出现的思想趋势，也并非仅限于已经屈服于此的那些国家，而是在整个欧洲蔓延。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> Though the first task must now be to win the war, to win it will only gain us another opportunity to face the basic problems and to find a way of averting the fate which has overtaken kindred civilizations. <!-- p2.s3 -->

[译文]
> 当前的首要任务无疑是赢得战争，但赢得战争只是为我们争取了另一次机会——去面对那些根本问题，去找到一条避免类似文明遭遇相同命运的出路。<!-- p2.s3 -->

[原文]
> Now, it is somewhat difficult to think of Germany and Italy, or of Russia, not as different worlds but as products of a development of thought in which we have shared; it is, at least so far as our enemies are concerned, easier and more comforting to think that they are entirely different from us and that what happened there cannot happen here. <!-- p3.s1 -->

[译文]
> 当下，我们很难把德国、意大利或俄国看作我们共同参与过的思想发展的产物，而是把它们当作完全不同的世界。这样想，无疑更容易，也更让人安心——尤其是当我们谈论那些敌国时，似乎可以确信它们与我们完全不同，那里发生的事不可能在这里重演。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> Yet the history of these countries in the years before the rise of the totalitarian system showed few features with which we are not familiar. The external conflict is a result of a transformation of European thought in which others have moved so much faster as to bring them into irreconcilable conflict with our ideals, but which has not left us unaffected. <!-- p3.s2 -->

[译文]
> 然而，这些国家在极权制度兴起之前的历史中，很少有什么特征是我们陌生的。当前的外部冲突，正是欧洲思想转变的结果。在这场转变中，其他国家走得比我们快得多，以至于他们与我们的理想产生了不可调和的冲突。但这并不意味着我们自己没有受到影响——我们同样受到了波及，只是程度不同而已。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> That a change of ideas and the force of human will have made the world what it is now, though men did not foresee the results, and that no spontaneous change in the facts obliged us thus to adapt our thought is perhaps particularly difficult for the Anglo-Saxon nations to see, just because in this development they have, fortunately for them, lagged behind most of the European peoples. <!-- p3.s3 -->

[译文]
> 现今世界的样貌是观念的转变和人的意志力塑造而成的。关键在于，人们当时并未预见到这些后果，也不是客观事实的自发变化迫使我们改变思想。恰恰相反，是我们主动选择了新的思想，从而塑造了现在的世界。对盎格鲁-撒克逊国家来说，这一点尤其难以看清，正因为他们幸运地在这场发展中落后于欧洲大多数民族。<!-- p3.s3 -->

[原文]
> We still think of the ideals which guide us, and have guided us for the past generation, as ideals only to be realized in the future and are not aware how far in the last twenty-five years they have already transformed not only the world but also our own countries. <!-- p3.s4 -->

[译文]
> 我们仍然把指引我们、在过去这一代人中一直指引我们的那些理想，看作是有待未来实现的理想。我们没有意识到，在过去二十五年里，这些理想已经在多大程度上改变了世界，也改变了我们自己的国家。<!-- p3.s4 -->

[原文]
> We still believe that until quite recently we were governed by what are vaguely called nineteenth-century ideas or the principle of laissez faire. Compared with some other countries, and from the point of view of those impatient to speed up the change, there may be some justification for such belief. <!-- p3.s5 -->

[译文]
> 我们仍然相信，直到最近为止，我们还是在那些模糊地称为"十九世纪思想"或"自由放任原则"的东西的统治下。与其他一些国家相比，从那些急于加快变革的人的角度来看，这种信念似乎还有些道理。<!-- p3.s5 -->

[原文]
> But although until 1931 England and America had followed only slowly on the path on which others had led, even by then they had moved so far that only those whose memory goes back to the years before the last war know what a liberal world has been like. <!-- p3.s6 -->

[译文]
> 但是,尽管直到1931年,英国和美国还只是缓慢地跟随着别人引领的道路,即便到那时,它们的改变也已经相当深远。只有那些记忆能够回溯到上次大战之前岁月的人，才真正知道一个自由主义的世界究竟是什么样的。[注-原-2]<!-- p3.s6 -->

[原文]
> The crucial point of which our people are still so little aware is, however, not merely the magnitude of the changes which have taken place during the last generation but the fact that they mean a complete change in the direction of the evolution of our ideas and social order. <!-- p4.s1 -->

[译文]
> 我们的人民至今仍然几乎没有意识到的关键之处在于：这不仅仅是说过去这代人中发生的变化之大，更重要的是，这些变化意味着我们思想和社会秩序演化方向的彻底改变。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> For at least twenty-five years before the specter of totalitarianism became a real threat, we had progressively been moving away from the basic ideas on which Western civilization has been built. <!-- p4.s2 -->

[译文]
> 事实上，早在极权主义成为真正威胁之前的至少二十五年，我们就已经在逐步远离西方文明赖以建立的那些基本思想。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> That this movement on which we have entered with such high hopes and ambitions should have brought us face to face with the totalitarian horror has come as a profound shock to this generation, which still refuses to connect the two facts. <!-- p4.s3 -->

[译文]
> 我们曾怀着如此高远的希望和雄心踏上这条道路，却不料它却把我们引向了极权主义的恐怖。这对这一代人来说是深刻的震撼。然而这一代人至今仍然拒绝承认这两者之间的关联。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> Yet this development merely confirms the warnings of the fathers of the liberal philosophy which we still profess. We have progressively abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which personal and political freedom has never existed in the past. <!-- p4.s4 -->

[译文]
> 然而这种发展，恰恰证实了我们至今仍然尊崇的自由主义哲学的先驱者们曾经发出的警告。我们已经逐步放弃了经济事务中的那种自由——而在过去，若没有这种自由，真正的个人自由和政治自由就从未存在过。<!-- p4.s4 -->

[原文]
> Although we had been warned by some of the greatest political thinkers of the nineteenth century, by Tocqueville and Lord Acton, that socialism means slavery, we have steadily moved in the direction of socialism. And now that we have seen a new form of slavery arise before our eyes, we have so completely forgotten the warning that it scarcely occurs to us that the two things may be connected. <!-- p4.s5 -->

[译文]
> 十九世纪的伟大政治思想家托克维尔和阿克顿勋爵都曾警告我们：社会主义意味着奴役。[注-原-3] 然而我们还是坚定地朝着社会主义的方向前进。如今，当我们亲眼看到一种新的奴役形式在眼前兴起时，我们已经如此彻底地忘却了那些警告，以至于几乎想不到这两件事可能是有联系的。[注-原-4]<!-- p4.s5 -->

[原文]
> How sharp a break not only with the recent past but with the whole evolution of Western civilization the modern trend toward socialism means becomes clear if we consider it not merely against the background of the nineteenth century but in a longer historical perspective. <!-- p5.s1 -->

[译文]
> 如果我们不仅仅以十九世纪为参照，而是从更长远的历史视角来审视，就会清楚地看到：现代走向社会主义的趋势，不仅与最近的过去形成了鲜明对比，更是与西方文明的整个演化过程形成了剧烈的断裂。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> We are rapidly abandoning not the views merely of Cobden and Bright, of Adam Smith and Hume, or even of Locke and Milton, but one of the salient characteristics of Western civilization as it has grown from the foundations laid by Christianity and the Greeks and Romans. <!-- p5.s2 -->

[译文]
> 我们正在迅速放弃的，不仅仅是科布登和布赖特的观点，不仅仅是亚当·斯密和休谟的思想，甚至也不仅仅是洛克和弥尔顿的理想。[注-原-5] 我们正在放弃的，是西方文明本身的一个根本特征——这个特征从基督教以及古代希腊和罗马人奠定的基础上生长出来，代代相传。<!-- p5.s2 -->

[原文]
> Not merely nineteenth- and eighteenth-century liberalism, but the basic individualism inherited by us from Erasmus and Montaigne, from Cicero and Tacitus, Pericles and Thucydides, is progressively relinquished. <!-- p5.s3 -->

[译文]
> 我们正在逐步放弃的，不仅是十九和十八世纪的自由主义，更是我们从伊拉斯谟和蒙田、从西塞罗和塔西佗、从伯里克利和修昔底德那里继承下来的基本个人主义。[注-原-6]<!-- p5.s3 -->

[原文]
> The Nazi leader who described the National Socialist revolution as a counter-Renaissance spoke more truly than he probably knew. It was the decisive step in the destruction of that civilization which modern man had built up from the age of the Renaissance and which was, above all, an individualist civilization. <!-- p6.s1 -->

[译文]
> 一位纳粹领导人曾把国家社会主义革命称为"反文艺复兴"。他说的，比他自己可能意识到的还要真实。这确实是摧毁现代人从文艺复兴时代开始建立起来的那个文明的决定性一步。那个文明首先是一个个人主义的文明。<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> Individualism has a bad name today, and the term has come to be connected with egotism and selfishness. But the individualism of which we speak in contrast to socialism and all other forms of collectivism has no necessary connection with these. <!-- p6.s2 -->

[译文]
> 个人主义在当今已经名声不佳，这个词被与自私自利紧密相连。但我们所说的个人主义——与社会主义和所有形式的集体主义相对的那种个人主义——与自私自利没有必然的联系。[注-原-7]<!-- p6.s2 -->

[原文]
> Only gradually in the course of this book shall we be able to make clear the contrast between the two opposing principles. But the essential features of that individualism which, from elements provided by Christianity and the philosophy of classical antiquity, was first fully developed during the Renaissance and has since grown and spread into what we know as Western civilization—are the respect for the individual man qua man, that is, the recognition of his own views and tastes as supreme in his own sphere, however narrowly that may be circumscribed, and the belief that it is desirable that men should develop their own individual gifts and bents. <!-- p6.s3 -->

[译文]
> 这两个原则之间的对比，我们需要在本书的逐步展开中才能充分阐明。但我们可以先概括这种个人主义的基本特征。它源于基督教和古典哲学的丰富遗产，在文艺复兴时期得到充分发展，之后不断生长和传播，最终成为我们所知道的西方文明的基础。这种个人主义的两个核心特征是：第一，对人作为个体的尊重——承认每个人在自己的领域内有自主决定的权利，无论这个领域多么有限。第二，一种信念：人应当发展自己独特的天赋和才能，这是值得追求的目标。<!-- p6.s3 -->

[原文]
> "Freedom" and "liberty" are now words so worn with use and abuse that one must hesitate to employ them to express the ideals for which they stood during that period. "Tolerance" is, perhaps, the only word which still preserves the full meaning of the principle which during the whole of this period was in the ascendant and which only in recent times has again been in decline, to disappear completely with the rise of the totalitarian state. <!-- p6.s4 -->

[译文]
> "自由"这个词，经过了太多的使用和滥用，现在已经变得陈旧不堪，我们几乎不敢再用它来表达文艺复兴时期它所代表的那种理想。也许只有"宽容"这个词，仍然完整保留了那个时期所高扬、后来却日益衰落、最终在极权主义国家的兴起中彻底消失的原则的全部含义。<!-- p6.s4 -->

## 第二节：商业自由与文明的演进

[原文]
> The gradual transformation of a rigidly organized hierarchic system into one where men could at least attempt to shape their own life, where man gained the opportunity of knowing and choosing between different forms of life, is closely associated with the growth of commerce. <!-- p7.s1 -->

[译文]
> 商业的发展推动了一场深刻的社会变革。从刚性的等级组织体系，逐步演进到一个人们可以自我塑造人生的制度，一个人们能够认识并选择不同生活方式的制度。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> From the commercial cities of northern Italy the new view of life spread with commerce to the west and north, through France and the southwest of Germany to the Low Countries and the British Isles, taking firm root wherever there was no despotic political power to stifle it. <!-- p7.s2 -->

[译文]
> 从意大利北部的商业城市出发，这种新的生活观念随着商业向西向北传播，经由法国和德国西南部进入低地国家和英伦三岛。只要没有专制权力的扼杀，它就会牢牢扎根。<!-- p7.s2 -->

[原文]
> In the Low Countries and Britain it for a long time enjoyed its fullest development and for the first time had an opportunity to grow freely and to become the foundation of the social and political life of these countries. <!-- p7.s3 -->

[译文]
> 在低地国家和英国，它获得了最充分的发展，第一次有机会自由生长，并成为这些国家社会和政治生活的基础。<!-- p7.s3 -->

[原文]
> And it was from there that in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it again began to spread in a more fully developed form to the West and East, to the New World and to the center of the European continent, where devastating wars and political oppression had largely submerged the earlier beginnings of a similar growth. <!-- p7.s4 -->

[译文]
> 从这里，到了十七世纪末和十八世纪，它以更加成熟的形态重新向西向东传播，传向新大陆和欧洲大陆腹地——那些地方因战争和政治压迫，曾经扼杀了类似发展的早期萌芽。[注-原-8]<!-- p7.s4 -->

[原文]
> During the whole of this modern period of European history the general direction of social development was one of freeing the individual from the ties which had bound him to the customary or prescribed ways in the pursuit of his ordinary activities. <!-- p8.s1 -->

[译文]
> 在欧洲历史的整个现代时期，社会发展的总体方向是把个人从那些束缚他的纽带中解放出来——这些纽带曾使他在从事日常活动时必须遵循习俗或规定的方式。<!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> The conscious realization that the spontaneous and uncontrolled efforts of individuals were capable of producing a complex order of economic activities could come only after this development had made some progress. <!-- p8.s2 -->

[译文]
> 人类只有在经历了这样的发展之后，才能清楚地认识到：个人的自发努力虽然不受控制，却能够创造出复杂有序的经济活动体系。<!-- p8.s2 -->

[原文]
> The subsequent elaboration of a consistent argument in favor of economic freedom was the outcome of a free growth of economic activity which had been the undesigned and unforeseen by-product of political freedom. <!-- p8.s3 -->

[译文]
> 支持经济自由的理论框架，正是这一自由经济活动发展的产物——而这种发展本身是政治自由的意外收获，并非刻意设计的结果。<!-- p8.s3 -->

[原文]
> Perhaps the greatest result of the unchaining of individual energies was the marvelous growth of science which followed the march of individual liberty from Italy to England and beyond. <!-- p9.s1 -->

[译文]
> 也许释放个人能量的最伟大成果，就是科学的惊人进步——它紧紧跟随着个人自由从意大利向英国及更远地方的进军。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> That the inventive faculty of man had been no less in earlier periods is shown by the many highly ingenious automatic toys and other mechanical contrivances constructed while industrial technique still remained stationary and by the development in some industries which, like mining or watch-making, were not subject to restrictive controls. <!-- p9.s2 -->

[译文]
> 在更早的时代，人类的创新才能并未更弱。这可以从许多精巧的自动装置和机械发明中看出——这些东西是在工业技术仍然停滞时建造的。同样，采矿和钟表制造等不受限制性管制的行业的发展，也证实了这一点。<!-- p9.s2 -->

[原文]
> But the few attempts toward a more extended industrial use of mechanical inventions, some extraordinarily advanced, were promptly suppressed, and the desire for knowledge was stifled, so long as the dominant views were held to be binding for all: the beliefs of the great majority on what was right and proper were allowed to bar the way of the individual innovator. <!-- p9.s3 -->

[译文]
> 然而，一旦占主导的观点被视为对所有人都有约束力，创新就受到了压制。那些试图更广泛地应用机械发明的尝试——其中有些异常先进——被迅速扼杀了，对知识的渴望也被窒息了。大多数人关于什么是正确和恰当的观点，被用来阻挡个体创新者的前路。<!-- p9.s3 -->

[原文]
> Only since industrial freedom opened the path to the free use of new knowledge, only since everything could be tried—if somebody could be found to back it at his own risk—and, it should be added, as often as not from outside the authorities officially entrusted with the cultivation of learning, has science made the great strides which in the last hundred and fifty years have changed the face of the world. <!-- p9.s4 -->

[译文]
> 只有当工业自由开辟了自由运用新知识的道路后，只有当任何想法都可以尝试——只要能找到愿意自担风险的支持者——尤其是来自官方学术权威之外的力量，科学才取得了在过去一百五十年里改变世界面貌的巨大进步。<!-- p9.s4 -->

[原文]
> As is so often true, the nature of our civilization has been seen more clearly by its enemies than by most of its friends: "the perennial Western malady, the revolt of the individual against the species," as that nineteenth-century totalitarian, Auguste Comte, has described it, was indeed the force which built our civilization. <!-- p10.s1 -->

[译文]
> 正如经常出现的情况那样，我们文明的本质被它的敌人看得比它的大多数朋友更清楚。十九世纪的极权主义者奥古斯特·孔德称之为"西方的永久性疾病，个人对群体的反叛"。讽刺的是，恰恰正是这种"疾病"，建立并推动了我们的文明。[注-原-9]<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> What the nineteenth century added to the individualism of the preceding period was merely to make all classes conscious of freedom, to develop systematically and continuously what had grown in a haphazard and patchy manner, and to spread it from England and Holland over most of the European continent. <!-- p10.s2 -->

[译文]
> 十九世纪对前一时期个人主义的贡献，仅仅是让所有阶层都意识到了自由的价值，系统而持续地发展那些曾以零散和不完整方式生长的东西，并从英国和荷兰向欧洲大陆的大部分地区传播。<!-- p10.s2 -->

[原文]
> The result of this growth surpassed all expectations. <!-- p11.s1 -->

[译文]
> 这一发展的结果超出了所有预期。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> Wherever the barriers to the free exercise of human ingenuity were removed, man became rapidly able to satisfy ever widening ranges of desire. <!-- p11.s2 -->

[译文]
> 只要人类才智的自由发挥的障碍被移除，人们就迅速能够满足越来越广泛的需求。<!-- p11.s2 -->

[原文]
> And while the rising standard soon led to the discovery of very dark spots in society, spots which men were no longer willing to tolerate, there was probably no class that did not substantially benefit from the general advance. <!-- p11.s3 -->

[译文]
> 虽然不断提升的生活水平很快让人们发现了社会中仍然存在的黑暗角落——这些角落人们不再愿意容忍——但可以说，大概没有哪个阶级没有从这种总体进步中获得实质性的收益。<!-- p11.s3 -->

[原文]
> We cannot do justice to this astonishing growth if we measure it by our present standards, which themselves result from this growth and now make many defects obvious. <!-- p11.s4 -->

[译文]
> 如果我们用现在的标准来衡量这种惊人的发展，就无法公正地评价它——因为我们现在的标准本身就是这种发展的产物，现在所以能看清许多缺陷，也正因为我们已经有了更高的要求。<!-- p11.s4 -->

[原文]
> To appreciate what it meant to those who took part in it, we must measure it by the hopes and wishes men held when it began: and there can be no doubt that its success surpassed man's wildest dreams, that by the beginning of the twentieth century the workingman in the Western world had reached a degree of material comfort, security, and personal independence which a hundred years before had seemed scarcely possible. <!-- p11.s5 -->

[译文]
> 要理解它对参与者意味着什么，我们应该用他们当初怀抱的希望和愿景来衡量。毫无疑问，这一成功超越了人类最狂野的梦想。到二十世纪初，西方世界的工人已经达到了物质舒适、安全和个人独立的程度，这在一百年前几乎是不可想象的。<!-- p11.s5 -->

## 第三节：成功带来的雄心与自由主义的危机

[原文]
> What in the future will probably appear the most significant and far-reaching effect of this success is the new sense of power over their own fate, the belief in the unbounded possibilities of improving their own lot, which the success already achieved created among men. <!-- p12.s1 -->

[译文]
> 从长远看，这一成功最深远的影响，可能是它在人们心中创造了一种新的力量感——对自己命运的掌控力，对改善自己处境的无限可能性的信念。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> With the success grew ambition—and man had every right to be ambitious. <!-- p12.s2 -->

[译文]
> 随着成功而来的是更大的雄心。而且，人有充分的理由感到雄心勃勃。<!-- p12.s2 -->

[原文]
> What had been an inspiring promise seemed no longer enough, the rate of progress far too slow; and the principles which had made this progress possible in the past came to be regarded more as obstacles to speedier progress, impatiently to be brushed away, than as the conditions for the preservation and development of what had already been achieved. <!-- p12.s3 -->

[译文]
> 曾经令人鼓舞的承诺似乎不再充分，进步的速度似乎太慢了。那些曾经使这种进步成为可能的原则，越来越被视为加快进步的障碍——人们急不可耐地想要扫除它——而不再被视为保存和发展已有成就的必要条件。<!-- p12.s3 -->

[原文]
> There is nothing in the basic principles of liberalism to make it a stationary creed; there are no hard-and-fast rules fixed once and for all. <!-- p13.s1 -->

[译文]
> 自由主义的基本原则中没有任何东西使它成为一个停滞的信条。它没有一劳永逸的硬性规则。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> The fundamental principle that in the ordering of our affairs we should make as much use as possible of the spontaneous forces of society, and resort as little as possible to coercion, is capable of an infinite variety of applications. <!-- p13.s2 -->

[译文]
> 基本原则很简单：在安排我们的事务时，应该尽可能多地利用社会的自发力量，尽可能少地诉诸强制。但这个原则能够以无限多样的具体方式得到应用。<!-- p13.s2 -->

[原文]
> There is, in particular, all the difference between deliberately creating a system within which competition will work as beneficially as possible and passively accepting institutions as they are. <!-- p13.s3 -->

[译文]
> 特别是，主动创造一个能让竞争最有益地运作的制度，与被动接受现存制度之间，有着本质的区别。<!-- p13.s3 -->

[原文]
> Probably nothing has done so much harm to the liberal cause as the wooden insistence of some liberals on certain rough rules of thumb, above all the principle of laissez faire. <!-- p13.s4 -->

[译文]
> 也许没有什么比某些自由主义者对某些粗略经验法则的僵化执着更伤害自由主义事业了。最臭名昭著的，就是对"自由放任"原则的教条式坚持。<!-- p13.s4 -->

[原文]
> Yet, in a sense, this was necessary and unavoidable. <!-- p13.s5 -->

[译文]
> 然而，从某种意义上说，这也是必要的，甚至不可避免的。<!-- p13.s5 -->

[原文]
> Against the innumerable interests which could show that particular measures would confer immediate and obvious benefits on some, while the harm they caused was much more indirect and difficult to see, nothing short of some hard-and-fast rule would have been effective. <!-- p13.s6 -->

[译文]
> 面对无数既得利益者——他们总能证明特定措施会给某些人带来立竿见影的好处，而伤害却要间接得多、难以看清——除非有某种硬性规则来对抗，否则就无法有效地阻止这类措施。<!-- p13.s6 -->

[原文]
> And since a strong presumption in favor of industrial liberty had undoubtedly been established, the temptation to present it as a rule which knew no exceptions was too strong always to be resisted. <!-- p13.s7 -->

[译文]
> 既然支持工业自由的强烈推定已经确立，要把它呈现为一条没有例外的规则的诱惑，就往往太强了，不易抗拒。<!-- p13.s7 -->

[原文]
> But, with this attitude taken by many popularizers of the liberal doctrine, it was almost inevitable that, once their position was penetrated at some points, it should soon collapse as a whole. <!-- p14.s1 -->

[译文]
> 然而，许多自由主义学说的通俗化者采取了这种态度，结果使得防线变得脆弱。一旦在某些点被攻破，整个阵地就会迅速崩溃。这几乎是不可避免的。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> The position was further weakened by the inevitably slow progress of a policy which aimed at a gradual improvement of the institutional framework of a free society. <!-- p14.s2 -->

[译文]
> 这个立场进一步被削弱了。因为旨在逐步改善自由社会制度框架的政策，其进展不可避免地缓慢。<!-- p14.s2 -->

[原文]
> This progress depended on the growth of our understanding of the social forces and the conditions most favorable to their working in a desirable manner. <!-- p14.s3 -->

[译文]
> 这种进步的前提是我们对社会力量及其最优运作条件的理解能够不断深化。<!-- p14.s3 -->

[原文]
> Since the task was to assist, and where necessary to supplement, their operation, the first requisite was to understand them. <!-- p14.s4 -->

[译文]
> 既然任务是协助、在必要时补充这些力量的运作，最首要的就是理解它们。<!-- p14.s4 -->

[原文]
> The attitude of the liberal toward society is like that of the gardener who tends a plant and, in order to create the conditions most favorable to its growth, must know as much as possible about its structure and the way it functions. <!-- p14.s5 -->

[译文]
> 自由主义者对社会的态度，就像园丁对待植物一样。为了创造最有利于其生长的条件，他必须尽可能地了解它的结构和运作方式。<!-- p14.s5 -->

[原文]
> No sensible person should have doubted that the crude rules in which the principles of economic policy of the nineteenth century were expressed were only a beginning—that we had yet much to learn and that there were still immense possibilities of advancement on the lines on which we had moved. <!-- p15.s1 -->

[译文]
> 没有明智的人应该怀疑，十九世纪经济政策原则的那些粗糙表述只是一个开端。我们还有很多要学习，在我们已经开辟的道路上仍然有巨大的进步空间。<!-- p15.s1 -->

[原文]
> But this advance could come only as we gained increasing intellectual mastery of the forces of which we had to make use. <!-- p15.s2 -->

[译文]
> 但这种进步只有在我们对必须利用的那些力量获得日益增长的理解时，才能实现。<!-- p15.s2 -->

[原文]
> There were many obvious tasks, such as our handling of the monetary system and the prevention or control of monopoly, and an even greater number of less obvious but hardly less important tasks to be undertaken in other fields, where there could be no doubt that the governments possessed enormous powers for good and evil; and there was every reason to expect that, with a better understanding of the problems, we should some day be able to use these powers successfully. <!-- p15.s3 -->

[译文]
> 许多明显的任务等待我们，比如处理货币体系、防止或控制垄断。还有更多不那么显而易见但同样重要的任务在其他领域等待。在这些领域，毫无疑问政府拥有巨大的善恶权力。我们有充分理由期待，随着对问题理解的深化，我们终有一天能够成功地运用这些权力。<!-- p15.s3 -->

[原文]
> But while the progress toward what is commonly called "positive" action was necessarily slow, and while for the immediate improvement liberalism had to rely largely on the gradual increase of wealth which freedom brought about, it had constantly to fight proposals which threatened this progress. <!-- p16.s1 -->

[译文]
> 但是，尽管朝着通常所说的"积极"行动的进步必然缓慢，尽管为了立竿见影的改善自由主义不得不主要依靠自由带来的财富的逐步增长，它却必须不断对抗那些威胁这一进步的提议。<!-- p16.s1 -->

[原文]
> It came to be regarded as a "negative" creed because it could offer to particular individuals little more than a share in the common progress—a progress which came to be taken more and more for granted and was no longer recognized as the result of the policy of freedom. <!-- p16.s2 -->

[译文]
> 它开始被视为一种"消极"的信条。这是因为它能给特定个人提供的，不过是在共同进步中的一份。而这种进步越来越被视为理所当然，不再被认为是自由政策的直接结果。<!-- p16.s2 -->

[原文]
> It might even be said that the very success of liberalism became the cause of its decline. <!-- p16.s3 -->

[译文]
> 甚至可以说，正是自由主义的成功，最终导致了它的衰落。<!-- p16.s3 -->

[原文]
> Because of the success already achieved, man became increasingly unwilling to tolerate the evils still with him which now appeared both unbearable and unnecessary. <!-- p16.s4 -->

[译文]
> 正因为已经取得的成功，人们越来越不愿意容忍仍然存在的那些恶。这些恶现在看来既无法忍受，也似乎是不必要的。[注-原-10]<!-- p16.s4 -->

## 第四节：从自由主义到社会主义的转变

[原文]
> Because of the growing impatience with the slow advance of liberal policy, the just irritation with those who used liberal phraseology in defense of antisocial privileges, and the boundless ambition seemingly justified by the material improvements already achieved, it came to pass that toward the turn of the century the belief in the basic tenets of liberalism was more and more relinquished. <!-- p17.s1 -->

[译文]
> 到世纪之交时，人们对自由主义基本信条的信仰越来越淡薄。这有三个原因：一是对自由主义政策缓慢进展的日益不耐烦；二是有些人用自由主义的言辞为反社会的特权进行辩护，这引起了正当的愤怒；三是已有成就似乎证明了无限雄心的合理性。<!-- p17.s1 -->

[原文]
> What had been achieved came to be regarded as a secure and imperishable possession, acquired once and for all. <!-- p17.s2 -->

[译文]
> 人们开始把已经取得的成就视为理所当然——一种安全而永久的财产，已经一劳永逸地获得了。<!-- p17.s2 -->

[原文]
> The eyes of the people became fixed on the new demands, the rapid satisfaction of which seemed to be barred by the adherence to the old principles. <!-- p17.s3 -->

[译文]
> 人们的目光转向了新的诉求。在他们看来，坚持旧原则阻碍了这些诉求的快速满足。<!-- p17.s3 -->

[原文]
> It became more and more widely accepted that further advance could be expected not along the old lines within the general framework which had made past progress possible but only by a complete remodeling of society. <!-- p17.s4 -->

[译文]
> 一个观点越来越被广泛接受：要想取得进一步的进步，就不能再沿着旧路线前进。那个使过去进步成为可能的总体框架已经过时，唯有彻底改造社会才行。<!-- p17.s4 -->

[原文]
> It was no longer a question of adding to or improving the existing machinery but of completely scrapping and replacing it. <!-- p17.s5 -->

[译文]
> 问题已经不是如何改进现有的机制，而是要彻底废弃它，用新的来替换。<!-- p17.s5 -->

[原文]
> And, as the hope of the new generation came to be centered on something completely new, interest in and understanding of the functioning of the existing society rapidly declined; and, with the decline of the understanding of the way in which the free system worked, our awareness of what depended on its existence also decreased. <!-- p17.s6 -->

[译文]
> 新一代人的希望寄托在某种全新的东西上。因此，他们对现存社会如何运作的兴趣和理解迅速衰退。随着人们越来越不理解自由制度是如何运作的，他们也越来越意识不到有什么依赖于这个制度的存在。<!-- p17.s6 -->

[原文]
> This is not the place to discuss how this change in outlook was fostered by the uncritical transfer to the problems of society of habits of thought engendered by the preoccupation with technological problems, the habits of thought of the natural scientist and the engineer, and how these at the same time tended to discredit the results of the past study of society which did not conform to their prejudices and to impose ideals of organization on a sphere to which they are not appropriate. <!-- p18.s1 -->

[译文]
> 至于这种观念转变是如何被催生的，这里不是讨论这个问题的适当之处。[注-原-11] 简言之，人们专注于技术问题，形成了自然科学家和工程师的思维习惯，随后不加批判地把这些思维习惯转移到社会问题上。这既导致了对过往社会研究成果的贬低——只要不符合这些思维习惯的偏见——又导致了把组织理想强加到一个并不适用的领域。这些发展的具体过程，暂且不在这里讨论。<!-- p18.s1 -->

[原文]
> All we are here concerned to show is how completely, though gradually and by almost imperceptible steps, our attitude toward society has changed. <!-- p18.s2 -->

[译文]
> 我们现在只想说明一个事实：我们对社会的态度已经彻底改变。虽然这种改变是逐渐的、几乎无法察觉的，但改变确实发生了。<!-- p18.s2 -->

[原文]
> What at every stage of this process of change had appeared a difference of degree only has in its cumulative effect already brought about a fundamental difference between the older liberal attitude toward society and the present approach to social problems. <!-- p18.s3 -->

[译文]
> 在变化的每个阶段看起来只是程度上的区别，但累积起来就产生了本质的差异。旧自由主义对待社会的态度，与当下处理社会问题的方法，已经有了根本性的区别。<!-- p18.s3 -->

[原文]
> The change amounts to a complete reversal of the trend we have sketched, an entire abandonment of the individualist tradition which has created Western civilization. <!-- p18.s4 -->

[译文]
> 这种变化意味着什么？它意味着我们前面勾勒的那个趋势完全逆转了。它意味着对个人主义传统的彻底放弃——而西方文明正是建立在这个传统之上。<!-- p18.s4 -->

[原文]
> According to the views now dominant, the question is no longer how we can make the best use of the spontaneous forces found in a free society. <!-- p19.s1 -->

[译文]
> 按照现在占主导地位的观点，问题已经不再是：我们如何才能最好地利用自由社会中的那些自发力量？<!-- p19.s1 -->

[原文]
> We have in effect undertaken to dispense with the forces which produced unforeseen results and to replace the impersonal and anonymous mechanism of the market by collective and "conscious" direction of all social forces to deliberately chosen goals. <!-- p19.s2 -->

[译文]
> 我们实际上已经着手两件事。第一，摒弃那些会产生未预见结果的力量。第二，用集体的、"有意识的"指导来取代市场那种非人格化、匿名的机制，把所有社会力量都引向刻意选定的目标。<!-- p19.s2 -->

[原文]
> The difference cannot be better illustrated than by the extreme position taken in a widely acclaimed book on whose program of so-called "planning for freedom" we shall have to comment yet more than once. <!-- p19.s3 -->

[译文]
> 这种差异有多大？一本广受赞誉的著作中的极端立场很好地说明了这一点。这本书提出了所谓"为自由而规划"的纲领，我们稍后还要不止一次地对其进行评论。<!-- p19.s3 -->

[原文]
> "We have never had to set up and direct," writes Dr. Karl Mannheim, "the entire system of nature as we are forced to do today with society. . . . Mankind is tending more and more to regulate the whole of its social life, although it has never attempted to create a second nature." <!-- p19.s4 -->

[译文]
> 卡尔·曼海姆博士写道："我们从来不必去建立和指导整个自然系统，但今天我们却被迫对社会这样做。……人类越来越倾向于规制其社会生活的全部，尽管它从未试图创造第二自然。"[注-原-12]<!-- p19.s4 -->

## 第五节：思想运动的地理逆转——从西向东

[原文]
> It is significant that this change in the trend of ideas has coincided with a reversal of the direction in which ideas have traveled in space. <!-- p20.s1 -->

[译文]
> 值得注意的是，思想趋势的这种转变，恰好与思想传播方向的逆转同时发生。<!-- p20.s1 -->

[原文]
> For over two hundred years English ideas had been spreading eastward. <!-- p20.s2 -->

[译文]
> 两百多年来，英国的思想一直在向东传播。<!-- p20.s2 -->

[原文]
> The rule of freedom which had been achieved in England seemed destined to spread throughout the world. <!-- p20.s3 -->

[译文]
> 英国已经实现的自由统治，似乎注定要传遍全世界。<!-- p20.s3 -->

[原文]
> By about 1870 the reign of these ideas had probably reached its easternmost expansion. <!-- p20.s4 -->

[译文]
> 到1870年左右，这些思想的统治可能已经达到了最东端的扩张。<!-- p20.s4 -->

[原文]
> From then onward it began to retreat, and a different set of ideas, not really new but very old, began to advance from the East. <!-- p20.s5 -->

[译文]
> 从那时起，它开始退却。与此同时，一套不同的思想开始从东方推进——这些思想并非真正新颖，而是非常古老。<!-- p20.s5 -->

[原文]
> England lost her intellectual leadership in the political and social sphere and became an importer of ideas. <!-- p20.s6 -->

[译文]
> 英国失去了在政治和社会领域的思想领导地位，变成了思想的进口国。<!-- p20.s6 -->

[原文]
> For the next sixty years Germany became the center from which the ideas destined to govern the world in the twentieth century spread east and west. <!-- p20.s7 -->

[译文]
> 在接下来的六十年里，德国成为新的思想中心。那些注定要在二十世纪统治世界的思想，从这里向东向西传播。<!-- p20.s7 -->

[原文]
> Whether it was Hegel or Marx, List or Schmoller, Sombart or Mannheim, whether it was socialism in its more radical form or merely "organization" or "planning" of a less radical kind, German ideas were everywhere readily imported and German institutions imitated. <!-- p20.s8 -->

[译文]
> 无论是黑格尔还是马克思，无论是李斯特还是施莫勒，无论是桑巴特还是曼海姆；无论是激进形式的社会主义，还是不那么激进的"组织"或"规划"——德国思想到处都被欣然接纳，德国制度到处都被模仿。[注-原-13]<!-- p20.s8 -->

[原文]
> Although most of the new ideas, and particularly socialism, did not originate in Germany, it was in Germany that they were perfected and during the last quarter of the nineteenth and the first quarter of the twentieth century that they reached their fullest development. <!-- p21.s1 -->

[译文]
> 大多数新思想，特别是社会主义，虽然并非起源于德国，但正是在德国，它们得到了完善。在十九世纪最后的二十五年和二十世纪最初的二十五年，它们在德国达到了最充分的发展。<!-- p21.s1 -->

[原文]
> It is now often forgotten how very considerable was the lead which Germany had during this period in the development of the theory and practice of socialism; that a generation before socialism became a serious issue in this country, Germany had a large socialist party in her parliament and that until not very long ago the doctrinal development of socialism was almost entirely carried on in Germany and Austria, so that even today Russian discussion largely carries on where the Germans left off. <!-- p21.s2 -->

[译文]
> 现在人们常常忘记，在这一时期德国在社会主义理论和实践发展方面的领先程度有多大。几个事实足以说明这一点：第一，在社会主义成为英美的严重问题之前的一代人，德国议会中就已经有了一个庞大的社会主义政党。第二，直到不久之前，社会主义的学理发展几乎完全在德国和奥地利进行。第三，即使在今天，俄国的讨论在很大程度上也是从德国人停下的地方继续的。<!-- p21.s2 -->

[原文]
> Most English and American socialists are still unaware that the majority of the problems they begin to discover were thoroughly discussed by German socialists long ago. <!-- p21.s3 -->

[译文]
> 大多数英国和美国社会主义者仍然没有意识到：他们开始发现的大多数问题，早已被德国社会主义者彻底讨论过了。[注-原-14]<!-- p21.s3 -->

[原文]
> The intellectual influence which German thinkers were able to exercise during this period on the whole world was supported not merely by the great material progress of Germany but even more by the extraordinary reputation which German thinkers and scientists had earned during the preceding hundred years when Germany had once more become an integral and even leading member of the common European civilization. <!-- p22.s1 -->

[译文]
> 在这一时期，德国思想家对全世界施加思想影响的能力，有两个支撑。一个是德国巨大的物质进步。另一个更重要的支撑，是德国思想家和科学家在前一个世纪赢得的非凡声誉——在那一个世纪里，德国再次成为共同的欧洲文明的完整成员，甚至是领导成员。<!-- p22.s1 -->

[原文]
> But it soon served to assist the spreading from Germany of ideas directed against the foundations of that civilization. <!-- p22.s2 -->

[译文]
> 然而这种声誉很快被用来做另一件事：协助从德国传播那些针对欧洲文明基础的思想。<!-- p22.s2 -->

[原文]
> The Germans themselves—or at least those among them who spread these ideas—were fully aware of the conflict: what had been the common heritage of European civilization became to them, long before the Nazis, "Western" civilization—where "Western" was no longer used in the old sense of Occident but had come to mean west of the Rhine. <!-- p22.s3 -->

[译文]
> 德国人自己——至少是其中传播这些思想的那些人——完全意识到了这种冲突。在纳粹之前很久，他们就已经把曾经是欧洲文明共同遗产的东西称为"西方"文明。这里的"西方"不再是旧意义上的西方(Occident)，而是指莱茵河以西。<!-- p22.s3 -->

[原文]
> "Western" in this sense was liberalism and democracy, capitalism and individualism, free trade and any form of internationalism or love of peace. <!-- p22.s4 -->

[译文]
> 这个意义上的"西方"包括什么呢？包括自由主义和民主，包括资本主义和个人主义，包括自由贸易和任何形式的国际主义或对和平的热爱。<!-- p22.s4 -->

[原文]
> But in spite of the ill-concealed contempt of an ever increasing number of Germans for those "shallow" Western ideals, or perhaps because of it, the people of the West continued to import German ideas and were even induced to believe that their own former convictions had merely been rationalizations of selfish interests, that free trade was a doctrine invented to further British interests, and that the political ideals of England and America were hopelessly outmoded and a thing to be ashamed of. <!-- p22.s5 -->

[译文]
> 越来越多的德国人对那些"肤浅的"西方理想毫不掩饰地表示蔑视。然而，尽管如此，或者也许正是因为如此，西方人民继续进口德国思想。他们甚至被诱导相信：他们自己以前的信念，不过是自私利益的合理化；自由贸易，不过是为了推进英国利益而发明的学说；英国和美国的政治理想，已经绝望地过时了，是应当为之感到羞耻的东西。<!-- p22.s5 -->

## 注释

### 原注

[注-原-1] 富兰克林·D·罗斯福，《关于遏制垄断和经济权力集中的国会建议》，载《争取自由主义的持续斗争》，《富兰克林·D·罗斯福公共文件与演说集》第7卷（纽约：麦克米伦，1941年），第320页。该演说发表于1938年4月29日。罗斯福在演说中哀叹美国企业界权力的集中，或称"集体主义"，呼吁通过更多联邦商业管制来重新引入"民主竞争秩序"。哈耶克当时对美国相对于英国在自由企业方面的未来道路更为乐观。

[注-原-2] 即便在1931年这一年，《麦克米伦报告》已经可以谈及"近年来本国政府观念的转变，无论哪个政党执政，政府都日益关注对人民生活的管理"，并补充说"议会发现自己越来越多地从事这样的立法活动：其有意识的目标是规范社会的日常事务，如今它干预的事情在过去被认为完全不在其职权范围之内。"这番话是在1931年之前说的。后来在同一年，英国最终一头扎了进去，在1931-39年那短短而不光彩的几年里，把自己的经济体系改造得面目全非。[Hayek refers to the Committee on Finance and Industry Report, Cmd. 3897 (London: HMSO, 1931)]

[注-原-3] 关于阿克顿和托克维尔的更多内容，参见1956年美国平装版序言，注10和注22。

[注-原-4] 甚至那些已被证明可怕地应验了的、时间上离我们更近的警告，也几乎完全被遗忘了。距今不到三十年前，希莱尔·贝洛克在一本书中解释说"社会主义学说对资本主义社会的影响，是产生出一个不同于其两个孕育者的第三种东西——也就是奴役国家"。这本书对后来德国发生的事情的解释，超过了大多数事后写成的著作。[French-born British writer Hilaire Belloc (1870–1953), The Servile State (1912)]

[注-原-5] 英国政治家理查德·科布登（1804-1865）和约翰·布赖特（1811-1889），都是反谷物法同盟的杰出成员，是十九世纪英国自由贸易的坚定倡导者。苏格兰政治经济学家亚当·斯密（1723-1790）在其经典著作《国富论》中赞扬自然自由体系，抨击重商主义对贸易的限制。苏格兰哲学家和历史学家（也是亚当·斯密的密友）大卫·休谟（1711-1776）是《人性论》的作者，这是英国经验主义传统的核心著作，他还著有多卷本《英国史》。英国哲学家约翰·洛克（1632-1704），英国经验主义传统的另一位成员，在《政府论两篇》中阐述了社会契约理论。英国诗人约翰·弥尔顿（1608-1674），《失乐园》和《复乐园》的作者，也写过支持英联邦和新闻自由的小册子。

[注-原-6] 文艺复兴人文主义者和世界主义学者德西德里乌斯·伊拉斯谟（1466-1536），"鹿特丹的伊拉斯谟"，是《愚人颂》的作者。法国作家米歇尔·德·蒙田（1533-1592）引入了散文作为一种文学形式。在他的散文中，他对可知之物采取怀疑态度，批评那些教条地持有观点的人。罗马政治家和文学家马库斯·图利乌斯·西塞罗（公元前106-43）以其演说技巧闻名；他反对马克·安东尼的《腓力比克》最终让他付出了生命的代价。在《编年史》和《历史》中，罗马历史学家普布利乌斯·塔西佗（约55-约120）记录了公元一世纪的罗马帝国。在雅典政治家伯里克利（公元前490-429）统治期间，雅典的建筑、雕塑和戏剧蓬勃发展。希腊历史学家修昔底德（约公元前460-约400）是《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》的作者。

[注-原-7] 哈耶克在他的文章《个人主义：真与伪》中批评了认为个人主义必然与自私自利相联系的观点。

[注-原-8] 这些发展中最具命运性的，是十五和十六世纪德国资产阶级被领土诸侯征服和部分摧毁的过程——这一过程的后果至今尚未消失。[哈耶克的读者会看到他的历史引用与第一次世界大战后的类比，当时恶性通货膨胀抹去了德国中产阶级债券持有人的储蓄，为希特勒的崛起铺平了道路。斯大林巩固权力时对富农的灭绝是另一个类比。]

[注-原-9] 奥古斯特·孔德，《实证政治体系》（1851-1854），第4卷（巴黎：实证主义书店，1912年），第368-369页。法国哲学家和社会理论家奥古斯特·孔德（1798-1857）声称知识有三个阶段——神学的、形而上学的和实证的——实证是最高的。实证知识已经在许多自然科学中获得，孔德主张应该在社会研究中引入实证主义。哈耶克在他的文章《科学的反革命》和《孔德与黑格尔》中阐述和批评了孔德的观点。

[注-原-10] 哈耶克在《经济思想的趋势》中提出了类似的论点。

[注-原-11] 作者曾试图在两组文章《唯科学主义与社会研究》和《科学的反革命》中追溯这一发展的开端，这些文章发表于《经济学》杂志1941-44年。[这些文章的修订版出现在《科学的反革命：论理性的滥用研究》中，分别在第17-182页和183-363页。]

[注-原-12] 卡尔·曼海姆，《重建时代的人与社会：现代社会结构研究》（伦敦：基根·保罗，1940年），第175-176页。[匈牙利出生的社会学家卡尔·曼海姆（1893-1947）曾在海德堡和法兰克福任教，1933年逃到伦敦经济学院。作为1933年3月根据希特勒的"公务员恢复法"被解职的第一批学者之一，他受邀作为访问教授，由贝弗里奇和他的伦敦经济学院同事设立的学术自由委员会赞助。曼海姆今天主要因他对知识社会学的贡献而被铭记。]

[注-原-13] 德国唯心主义哲学家格奥尔格·威廉·弗里德里希·黑格尔（1770-1831）阐述了描述意识演化和历史进程的辩证法，革命社会理论家卡尔·马克思（1818-1883）将其置于唯物主义框架内以预测资本主义的不可避免崩溃。在他的著作《政治经济学的国民体系》中，德国出生的政治经济学家弗里德里希·李斯特（1789-1846）主张贸易保护主义。他的许多政策建议也得到了德国历史学派经济学家的支持，其中古斯塔夫·施莫勒（1838-1917）是领袖。施莫勒与奥地利学派创始人卡尔·门格尔进行了方法论之争。资本主义发展史学家维尔纳·桑巴特（1863-1941）或许是历史学派的最后一位经济学家。哈耶克认为他从左翼社会主义转向法西斯式的反资本主义体现了一种自然趋势。

[注-原-14] 关于德国社会主义传统的更多信息，参见M. C. Howard和J. E. King，《马克思主义经济学史》，第1卷1883-1914年（普林斯顿：普林斯顿大学出版社，1989年）。哈耶克编辑《集体主义经济计划》一书的目标之一，是向他的英语读者介绍一些批评德语社会主义文献的关键文献。

### 译注

[注-译-1] "这里"指英国和美国等民主国家。本书写于1944年（第二次世界大战期间），哈耶克在此指的是：自由主义的价值观在战前就已经在英美民主社会内部受到来自社会主义等左翼思想的冲击和威胁。

[注-译-2] "别处"指德国、意大利等已经完全被纳粹和法西斯极权统治所吞没的国家。在这些国家，个人自由、民主、法治等西方文明的核心价值已经被彻底摧毁。哈耶克通过这个对比强调：英美虽然仍保有这些价值，但它们正在衰退的危险中。

# Introduction
# 导言

[原文]
> The Road to Serfdom is F. A. Hayek's most well-known book, but its origins were decidedly inauspicious. It began as a memo to the director of the London School of Economics, Sir William Beveridge, written by Hayek in the early 1930s and disputing the then-popular claim that fascism represented the dying gasp of a failed capitalist system. The memo grew into a magazine article, and parts of it were supposed to be incorporated into a much larger book, but during World War II he decided to bring it out separately. Though Hayek had no problem getting Routledge to publish the book in England, three American publishing houses rejected the manuscript before the University of Chicago Press finally accepted it. <!-- intro.s1 -->

[译文]
> 《通往奴役之路》是哈耶克最著名的著作，但它的起源却非常不顺。这部著作始于1930年代初哈耶克写给伦敦经济学院院长威廉·贝弗里奇爵士的一份备忘录。当时盛行的观点认为法西斯主义是衰亡的资本主义的最后垂死挣扎，哈耶克的备忘录就是对这一观点的驳斥。备忘录后来扩展为一篇杂志文章，部分内容本来要纳入一部更大的著作，但到了二战期间，哈耶克决定将其独立出版。在英国，罗特利奇出版社欣然接受了这部著作；在美国，虽经三家出版社拒绝，但终由芝加哥大学出版社接纳。<!-- intro.s1 -->

[原文]
> The book was written for a British audience, so the director of the Press, Joseph Brandt, did not expect it to be a big seller in the States. Brandt hoped to get the well-known New York Herald Tribune journalist and author Walter Lippmann to write the foreword, noting in an internal memo that if he did, it might sell between two and three thousand copies. Otherwise, he estimated, it might sell nine hundred. Unfortunately, Lippmann was busy with his own work and so turned him down, as did the 1940 Republican presidential candidate Wendell Wilkie, whose 1943 book One World had been a best-seller.[1] John Chamberlain, the book review editor for the New York Times, was ultimately recruited for the job. <!-- intro.s2 -->

[译文]
> 这部著作原本是为英国读者创作的，所以出版社主任约瑟夫·勃兰特对它在美国的销售前景并无高度期待。勃兰特曾希望邀请著名的《纽约先驱论坛报》记者和作家沃尔特·李普曼撰写序言。他在一份内部备忘录中指出，如果李普曼同意，此书可能会销售两三千册，否则估计只能卖出九百册。不幸的是，李普曼正忙于自己的著作而婉言谢绝了。1940年共和党总统候选人温德尔·威尔基也同样拒绝了（他在1943年出版的《一个世界》曾是畅销书）。[1] 最后，《纽约时报》书评编辑约翰·钱伯林接受了这份邀请。<!-- intro.s2 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> One hopes for his sake that Brandt was not the sort who bet money on his hunches. Since its first publication in 1944, the University of Chicago Press estimates that more than 350,000 copies of The Road to Serfdom have been sold. Routledge added many thousands more, but we do not know how many exactly: that press was unable to come up with any reliable numbers. There is also no good count on the number of copies that appeared in translation, not least because a portion were samizdat copies produced and distributed behind the Iron Curtain during the cold war.[2] <!-- intro.s3 -->

[译文]
> 我们只能寄希望于勃兰特不是那种好赌的人。自1944年首次出版以来，芝加哥大学出版社估计《通往奴役之路》已售出超过35万册。罗特利奇出版社还售出了数千册，但具体数字无从得知——那家出版社无法提供确切的统计数据。翻译版的销售情况更是难以统计，尤其是因为其中有相当一部分是在冷战期间在铁幕后面秘密印刷和流传的版本。[2] <!-- intro.s3 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> Not everyone, of course, liked (or likes) the book. The intelligentsia, particularly in the United States, greeted its publication with condescension and, occasionally, vitriol. Then a diplomat in the British Embassy in Washington, Isaiah Berlin wrote to a friend in April 1945 that he was "still reading the awful Dr. Hayek."[3] The economist Gardiner Means did not have Berlin's fortitude; after reading 50 pages he reported to William Benton of the Encyclopaedia Britannica that he "couldn't stomach any more."[4] The philosopher Rudolf Carnap, writing to Hayek's friend Karl Popper, apparently could not muster even the stamina of Means: "I was somewhat surprised to see your acknowledgement of von Hayek. I have not read his book myself; it is much read and discussed in this country, but praised mostly by the protagonists of free enterprise and unrestricted capitalism, while all leftists regard him as a reactionary."[5] <!-- intro.s4 -->

[译文]
> 当然，并非人人都对这部著作欣然接受。尤其在美国，知识精英对其出版的反应往往带有某种居高临下，有时甚至充满敌意。英国驻华盛顿大使馆的外交官以赛亚·伯林在1945年4月写信给朋友时说，他"仍在读那位可怕的哈耶克博士的著作"。[3] 经济学家加德纳·米恩斯没有伯林那份耐心；仅读了50页后，他就向大英百科全书的威廉·本顿抱怨说他"再也读不下去了"。[4] 哲学家鲁道夫·卡尔纳普在写给哈耶克的朋友卡尔·波普尔的信中态度更加直言不讳："我有些诧异地看到你对冯·哈耶克的认可。我自己还没读过他的书；这部著作在这个国家被广泛阅读和讨论，但主要得到自由企业和不受限制资本主义倡导者的称赞，而所有左翼人士都把他视为反动分子。"[5] <!-- intro.s4 -->

&nbsp;

## 第一节：书籍的起源与背景

[原文]
> Those who, like Carnap, have not read Hayek but think that they already know what he is all about should be prepared for some surprises. Those on the left might preview their reading with a peek at chapter 3, where Hayek expounds on some of the government intervention that he was prepared to accept, at least in 1944.[6] Those on the right might want to have a look at his distinction between a liberal and a conservative in his 1956 foreword to the American paperback edition. Both will be surprised by what they find. <!-- intro.s5 -->

[译文]
> 那些如同卡尔纳普一样，未曾读过哈耶克却自以为已经了解他的人，应该为可能的惊讶做好准备。左翼读者可以先看第三章，了解哈耶克所阐述的他愿意接受的某些政府干预措施——至少在1944年时他是持这种态度的。[6] 右翼读者则可以查看他在1956年美国平装版序言中关于自由主义者与保守主义者区别的论述。两派都会对自己发现的内容感到惊讶。<!-- intro.s5 -->

[原文]
> In this introduction I trace the origins of Hayek's little book, summoning up the context in which it was produced and showing how it gradually came to its final form. The reactions, both positive and negative, that ultimately turned it into a cultural icon will then be documented. Because it is a controversial work, I will comment upon some of the most persistent criticisms that have been levied against it. Not all of these, I argue, are warranted: Hayek's book may have been widely, but it was not always carefully, read. In my conclusion I will reflect briefly on its lasting messages.[7] <!-- intro.s6 -->

[译文]
> 在这篇导言中，我将追溯这部著作的起源，描述它产生的历史背景，并说明它如何逐步演变为最终的形式。然后我将记述对它的各种反应——无论积极还是消极——这些反应最终使它成为了一个文化象征。由于这部著作备具争议性，我也将对一些持久的批评做出评论。我的主张是，这些批评并非都站得住脚：虽然哈耶克的著作被广泛阅读，但不总是被仔细研读的。在结论中，我将简要思考它的深远影响。[7] <!-- intro.s6 -->

&nbsp;

## 第二节：英国、纳粹主义与社会主义

[原文]
> Friedrich A. Hayek, a young economist from Vienna, came to the London School of Economics (LSE) in early 1931 to deliver four lectures on monetary theory, later published as the book Prices and Production.[8] The topic was timely—Britain's economy, stagnant through the 1920s, had only gotten worse with the onset of the depression—and the presentation was erudite, if at times hard to follow, owing to Hayek's accent. On the basis of the lectures Hayek was offered a visiting professorship that began in the Michaelmas (fall) 1931 term, and a year later he was appointed to the Tooke Chair of Economic Science and Statistics. He would remain at the LSE until after the war. <!-- intro.s7 -->

[译文]
> 弗里德里希·奥古斯特·冯·哈耶克是一位来自维也纳的年轻经济学家，1931年初他来到伦敦经济学院（LSE）发表了四场关于货币理论的讲座。这些讲座后来出版成著作《价格与生产》。[8] 讲座的主题恰逢其时——英国经济在1920年代已经停滞，大萧条爆发后更是雪上加霜——他的演讲内涵深邃，虽然因为口音的缘故有时难以理解。基于这些讲座，哈耶克获得了访问教授职位，从1931年秋季学期开始任职，一年后被任命为经济学和统计学图克讲座教授。他在伦敦经济学院一直待到战后。<!-- intro.s7 -->

[原文]
> The summer before Hayek arrived to teach was a traumatic one in Britain and across Europe. In addition to the deepening economic depression, financial crises on the continent led to a gold drain in Britain, and ultimately to the collapse of the Labour government, the abandoning of the gold standard, and, in autumn, the imposition of protectionist tariffs. Hayek's entrance onto the London stage was itself accompanied by no little controversy. In August 1931 he caused a stir with the publication of the first half of a review of John Maynard Keynes's new book, A Treatise on Money, which drew a heated reply from Keynes a few months later. His battle with Keynes and, later, with Keynes's compatriot Piero Sraffa, would occupy no small amount of Hayek's attention during the 1931–32 academic year.[9] <!-- intro.s8 -->

[译文]
> 哈耶克来伦敦任教前的那个夏天对英国乃至整个欧洲都是充满创伤的。除了经济大萧条日益深化外，大陆金融危机导致英国黄金大量流出，最终引发工党政府倒台、金本位制放弃，以及秋天保护主义关税的实施。哈耶克登上伦敦舞台本身就充满了争议。1931年8月，他发表了对凯恩斯新著《货币论》的书评前半部分，几个月后凯恩斯给予了激烈的回应。他与凯恩斯的论争，以及后来与凯恩斯同乡皮埃罗·斯拉法的争论，在1931-32学年间占去了哈耶克大量的精力。[9] <!-- intro.s8 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> By the following year, however, Hayek had secured his chair, and for his inaugural lecture, delivered on March 1, 1933, he turned to a new subject.[10] He began with the following question: Why were economists, whose advice was often so useful, increasingly regarded by the general public as out of step with the times during the perilous years that had followed the last war? To answer it Hayek drew upon intellectual history. He claimed that public opinion was unduly influenced by an earlier generation of economists who, by criticizing a theoretical approach to the social sciences, had undermined the credibility of economic reasoning in general. Once that had been accomplished, people felt free to propose all manner of utopian solutions to the problem of the depression, solutions that any serious study of economics would show were infeasible. Toward the end of his talk Hayek cited the new enthusiasm for socialist planning in Britain as an example of such misguided ideas. The economists who had paved the way for these errors were members of the German Historical School, advisors to Bismarck in the last decades of the nineteenth century. <!-- intro.s9 -->

[译文]
> 到了第二年，哈耶克已经确保了自己的讲座职位。在1933年3月1日的就职演讲中，他开启了一个新的论题。[10] 他从这样一个问题开始：为什么经济学家虽然常常能给出有用的建议，却在战争之后那些危险的岁月里，越来越被公众视为与时代脱节的人？为了回答这个问题，哈耶克诉诸于思想史。他声称，公众舆论受到了较早一代经济学家的不当影响。这些经济学家通过批评社会科学的某一理论进路，削弱了经济论证本身的可信度。一旦如此，人们便觉得自由地可以提出五花八门的乌托邦方案来解决大萧条，而任何严肃的经济学研究都会表明这些方案根本行不通。在讲演接近尾声时，哈耶克举英国人对社会主义计划新近高涨的热情为例，来说明这类误导性观点。为这些错误开路的经济学家乃是德国历史学派的成员，是19世纪最后几十年俾斯麦时代的顾问。<!-- intro.s9 -->

[原文]
> Hayek's choice of the German Historical School economists was significant on a number of levels. First, the German Historical School had before the war been the chief rival of the Austrian School of Economics, of which Hayek was a member.[11] Next, though the German Historical School economists were conservative imperialists, cheerleaders for a strong German Reich and opponents of German social democracy, they also were the architects of numerous social welfare reforms. Bismarck embraced these reforms while at the same time repressing the socialists; indeed, the reforms were designed at least in part to undermine the socialist position and thereby strengthen the Empire. Hayek probably hoped that his audience would see certain parallels to the present day. Only a month before Adolf Hitler, who detested democracy and favored instead the reconstitution of another (third) Reich, had become Chancellor of the Weimar Republic. Within days he had convinced President Hindenburg to sign a decree prohibiting meetings and publications that could endanger public security, a measure aimed squarely at the communists and socialists. The morning before Hayek's address the world had learned that the Reichstag building had been set on fire and burned; the Nazis were quick to blame the act on the communists and used it to justify further acts of repression. A half century before, Bismarck had used an attempt on the Emperor's life to put his own anti-socialist laws in place. <!-- intro.s10 -->

[译文]
> 哈耶克选择德国历史学派经济学家作为讨论对象具有多重意义。首先，德国历史学派在战前一直是哈耶克所属的奥地利经济学派的主要对手。[11] 其次，虽然德国历史学派的经济学家是保守的帝国主义者，是强大的德意志帝国的拥护者，也是德国社会民主的反对者，但他们同时也是众多社会福利改革的设计者。俾斯麦采纳了这些改革，但同时也压制了社会主义者；实际上，这些改革至少在一定程度上是为了破坏社会主义的势力，从而巩固帝国。哈耶克可能希望听众能看出其中与当时德国局势的某些相似之处。仅仅一个月前，痛恨民主、妄图重建第三帝国的阿道夫·希特勒刚刚就任魏玛共和国总理。几天之内，他便说服了兴登堡总统签署了禁止危害公共安全集会和出版物的法令，这一措施直指共产党人和社会主义者。哈耶克讲话的前一天早晨，国会大厦遭纵火并被焚毁的消息传遍世界；纳粹分子迅速将责任推给共产党，并以此为借口进行进一步的镇压。半个世纪前，俾斯麦曾借口一次暗杀皇帝的事件来推行自己的反社会主义法律。<!-- intro.s10 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> After Hayek's speech the situation in Germany continued to deteriorate. In March there were wholesale arrests of communists and harassment of the social democratic leadership. Opposition newspapers were closed, constitutional protections swept away, and a notorious "enabling law" passed that gave Hitler virtually dictatorial powers. On April 1 a nationwide boycott against German Jews was called, and later in the month action against the trade unions began. In May students on university campuses across Germany held book-burning celebrations, cleansing their libraries of suspect volumes. One such event was staged in the Berlin Opernplatz on May 10, 1933, and the martial songs and speeches of the participants were broadcast live across Germany. It was a horrific spring. <!-- intro.s11 -->

[译文]
> 哈耶克讲话后，德国局势继续恶化。3月，共产党人遭到大规模逮捕，社民党领导人被骚扰。反对派报纸被查禁，宪法保护被废除，一项臭名昭著的"授权法"通过了，这赋予希特勒几乎无限的独裁权力。4月1日，全国范围内对德国犹太人的抵制活动启动，月底时矛头转向对工会的打击。5月，德国大学校园里的学生举行了焚书活动，清理图书馆中的"不良"书籍。其中一场在1933年5月10日在柏林国家歌剧广场举行，参加者的军歌和演讲被现场直播到整个德国。那是一个可怕的春天。<!-- intro.s11 -->

&nbsp;

[原文]
> Hayek's criticisms of socialism in his address were not well received. He would later recall that, following the talk, "one of the more intelligent students had the cheek to come to see me for the sole purpose of telling me that, though hitherto admired by the students, I had wholly destroyed my reputation by taking, in this lecture, a clearly anti-socialist position."[12] But even more disquieting for Hayek was the interpretation of events in Germany that was emerging among the British intelligentsia. Certain prominent members of the German industrial class had initially supported Hitler's rise, and others had acquiesced in it. This, together with the Nazi party's evident persecution of the left, led many in Britain to see Naziism as either a capitalist-inspired movement or, alternatively (if one were a Marxist, and believed that capitalism was doomed to collapse), as a last-ditch attempt by the bourgeoisie to deny the inexorable triumph of socialism. As Hayek recalled, his director at the LSE was one of the ones propagating such an interpretation: <!-- intro.s12 -->

[译文]
> 哈耶克讲话中对社会主义的批评没有获得好评。他后来回忆说，讲话后，"一位相当聪慧的学生居然有胆量来见我，唯一的目的就是告诉我，尽管我到此为止在学生中受人尊敬，但我在这次讲座中采取了明确的反社会主义立场，已经完全毁掉了我的名声。"[12] 但让哈耶克更感不安的，是英国知识界对德国事件所做的解读。德国工业界的某些杰出人物起初支持了希特勒的崛起，其他人则默许了这一切。加上纳粹党对左翼明显的迫害，英国许多人将纳粹主义理解为资本主义的产物，或者（如果一个人是马克思主义者，相信资本主义终将崩溃的话）理解为资产阶级为阻止不可避免的社会主义胜利做的最后挣扎。如哈耶克所回忆的，他在伦敦经济学院的主任正是宣传这种观点的人之一：<!-- intro.s12 -->

# 伟大的乌托邦

> 摘要：本章考察一个深刻的历史悖论。许多人曾真诚地相信，社会主义承诺的"新自由"必将开创人类的黄金时代。然而随着论证逐层推进，我们将看到，这看似进步的承诺却引领人类走向相反的方向——束缚。本章揭示社会主义（socialism）如何假自由之名而兴盛，剖析它与法西斯主义（fascism）之间令人惊讶的亲缘关系，并追根溯源地阐明双方的真正分歧。

## 第一节：社会主义作为自由理想的继承者

[原文]
> That socialism has displaced liberalism as the doctrine held by the great majority of progressives does not simply mean that people had forgotten the warnings of the great liberal thinkers of the past about the consequences of collectivism. <!-- p1.s1 -->

[译文]
社会主义（socialism）如今已取代自由主义（liberalism），成为大多数进步知识分子的信仰。但这种转变并非源于人们遗忘了过去自由主义伟大思想家的警告——他们曾深刻阐明集体主义（collectivism）的危害。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> It has happened because they were persuaded of the very opposite of what these men had predicted. <!-- p1.s2 -->

[译文]
相反，人们被说服去相信这些前辈所反对的东西。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> The extraordinary thing is that the same socialism that was not only early recognized as the gravest threat to freedom, but quite openly began as a reaction against the liberalism of the French Revolution, gained general acceptance under the flag of liberty. <!-- p1.s3 -->

[译文]
最令人惊讶的现象是：那个曾被视为对自由最大威胁、那个公然以反对法国大革命自由主义而诞生的社会主义，竟然堂皇地以"自由"的旗帜获得了普遍拥护。<!-- p1.s3 -->

[原文]
> It is rarely remembered now that socialism in its beginnings was frankly authoritarian. <!-- p2.s1 -->

[译文]
人们早已遗忘：社会主义的本来面目就是威权主义。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> The French writers who laid the foundations of modern socialism had no doubt that their ideas could be put into practice only by a strong dictatorial government. <!-- p2.s2 -->

[译文]
奠基现代社会主义的法国思想家毫无幻想：他们坦率地承认，自己的理想只能通过强大的独裁权力来实现。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> To them socialism meant an attempt to "terminate the revolution" by a deliberate reorganization of society on hierarchical lines and by the imposition of a coercive "spiritual power." <!-- p2.s3 -->

[译文]
在他们眼中，社会主义的目标是"结束革命"——用严格的等级制来重新组织社会，用强制的精神权力进行统治。<!-- p2.s3 -->

[原文]
> Where freedom was concerned, the founders of socialism made no bones about their intentions. <!-- p2.s4 -->

[译文]
在自由问题上，社会主义的创始人毫不掩饰自己的真实意图。<!-- p2.s4 -->

[原文]
> Freedom of thought they regarded as the root-evil of nineteenth-century society, and the first of modern planners, Saint-Simon, even predicted that those who did not obey his proposed planning boards would be "treated as cattle." <!-- p2.s5 -->

[译文]
他们将自由思考视为十九世纪社会的根本祸害。现代计划制度之父圣西门曾预言：凡不服从其计划委员会的人，将被"当作牲畜"对待。[注-原-2]<!-- p2.s5 -->

[原文]
> Only under the influence of the strong democratic currents preceding the revolution of 1848 did socialism begin to ally itself with the forces of freedom. <!-- p3.s1 -->

[译文]
直到1848年革命前夕涌起的强大民主浪潮，社会主义才开始与自由派力量结盟。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> But it took the new "democratic socialism" a long time to live down the suspicions aroused by its antecedents. <!-- p3.s2 -->

[译文]
但这个新生的"民主社会主义"花了漫长的岁月，才逐渐消解其前身所遗留的污名。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> Nobody saw more clearly than Tocqueville that democracy as an essentially individualist institution stood in an irreconcilable conflict with socialism: <!-- p3.s3 -->

[译文]
没有人比托克维尔看得更清楚：民主作为本质上尊崇个人主义（individualism）的制度，与社会主义（socialism）之间存在着根本的、无法调和的对立。<!-- p3.s3 -->

[原文]
> "Democracy extends the sphere of individual freedom," he said in 1848; "socialism restricts it. Democracy attaches all possible value to each man; socialism makes each man a mere agent, a mere number. Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word: equality. But notice the difference: while democracy seeks equality in liberty, socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude." <!-- p3.s4 -->

[译文]
他在1848年的论述中写道："民主扩展个人自由的范围，社会主义则压缩它。民主赋予每个人最大的价值，社会主义将每个人沦为工具、沦为数字。民主与社会主义除了'平等'这个词没有任何共同之处。但请看清差异：民主在自由中实现平等，社会主义在禁锢与奴役中实现平等。"[注-原-3]<!-- p3.s4 -->

## 第二节：集体主义的新自由承诺

[原文]
> To allay these suspicions and to harness to its cart the strongest of all political motives—the craving for freedom—socialism began increasingly to make use of the promise of a "new freedom." <!-- p4.s1 -->

[译文]
为了消除这些疑虑，也为了驾驭人类最强大的政治动力——对自由的渴望——社会主义越来越频繁地祭出"新自由"的承诺。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> The coming of socialism was to be the leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. <!-- p4.s2 -->

[译文]
社会主义的到来将是一次伟大的跨越：从必然性的绝望跳入自由的国度。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> It was to bring "economic freedom," without which the political freedom already gained was "not worth having." <!-- p4.s3 -->

[译文]
它将赋予人类"经济自由"（economic freedom）。少了这一点，已经赢得的政治自由就不过是空文而已。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> Only socialism was capable of effecting the consummation of the age-long struggle for freedom, in which the attainment of political freedom was but a first step. <!-- p4.s4 -->

[译文]
唯有社会主义才能完成人类千百年来追求自由的伟大事业。在这个宏大进程中，获得政治自由不过是开始。<!-- p4.s4 -->

[原文]
> The subtle change in meaning to which the word "freedom" was subjected in order that this argument should sound plausible is important. <!-- p5.s1 -->

[译文]
关键在于，为了让这套论证听起来可信，"自由"这个词的含义被悄悄改变了。<!-- p5.s1 -->

[原文]
> To the great apostles of political freedom the word had meant freedom from coercion, freedom from the arbitrary power of other men, release from the ties which left the individual no choice but obedience to the orders of a superior to whom he was attached. <!-- p5.s2 -->

[译文]
在政治自由的伟大阐述者眼中，"自由"指的是：摆脱强制，不被他人任意权力奴役，挣脱那种被迫服从上级的枷锁。<!-- p5.s2 -->

[原文]
> The new freedom promised, however, was to be freedom from necessity, release from the compulsion of the circumstances which inevitably limit the range of choice of all of us, although for some very much more than for others. <!-- p5.s3 -->

[译文]
而新的承诺则大不相同：那是"摆脱必然性的自由"——从物质贫困与缺乏的压迫中解放出来。这些客观的限制确实制约着我们所有人的选择，只是程度上有所不同。<!-- p5.s3 -->

[原文]
> Before man could be truly free, the "despotism of physical want" had to be broken, the "restraints of the economic system" relaxed. <!-- p5.s4 -->

[译文]
在人能真正获得自由之前，必须摧毁"物质匮乏的专制"，松动"经济体系的锁链"。<!-- p5.s4 -->

[原文]
> Freedom in this sense is, of course, merely another name for power or wealth. <!-- p6.s1 -->

[译文]
当然，这种意义上的"自由"只不过是权力或财富的另一个名称。[注-原-4]<!-- p6.s1 -->

[原文]
> Yet, although the promises of this new freedom were often coupled with irresponsible promises of a great increase in material wealth in a socialist society, it was not from such an absolute conquest of the niggardliness of nature that economic freedom was expected. <!-- p6.s2 -->

[译文]
虽然这种"新自由"的承诺经常伴随着社会主义社会物质财富大幅增长的夸大承诺，但人们对"经济自由"的期待并非来自物质的绝对丰裕。<!-- p6.s2 -->

[原文]
> What the promise really amounted to was that the great existing disparities in the range of choice of different people were to disappear. <!-- p6.s3 -->

[译文]
这个承诺的真正含义是：不同人之间在选择范围上的巨大差距将会消失。<!-- p6.s3 -->

[原文]
> The demand for the new freedom was thus only another name for the old demand for an equal distribution of wealth. <!-- p6.s4 -->

[译文]
因此，对"新自由"的需求只是对财富平等分配这一古老诉求的重新包装。<!-- p6.s4 -->

[原文]
> But the new name gave the socialists another word in common with the liberals, and they exploited it to the full. <!-- p6.s5 -->

[译文]
但这个新名词为社会主义者与自由主义者提供了新的共同语言，他们充分利用了这一点。<!-- p6.s5 -->

[原文]
> And, although the word was used in a different sense by the two groups, few people noticed this and still fewer asked themselves whether the two kinds of freedom promised could really be combined. <!-- p6.s6 -->

[译文]
尽管两个阵营赋予这个词完全不同的含义，但很少有人注意到，更少有人问自己：这两种承诺的自由真的能结合吗？<!-- p6.s6 -->

[原文]
> There can be no doubt that the promise of greater freedom has become one of the most effective weapons of socialist propaganda and that the belief that socialism would bring freedom is genuine and sincere. <!-- p7.s1 -->

[译文]
毫无疑问，更大自由的承诺已成为社会主义宣传最有力的武器之一。而那种"社会主义将带来自由"的信念确实是真诚的。<!-- p7.s1 -->

[原文]
> But this would only heighten the tragedy if it should prove that what was promised to us as the Road to Freedom was in fact the High Road to Servitude. <!-- p7.s2 -->

[译文]
如果事实证明，所谓的"通往自由之路"实际上是"通往奴役的大道"，这只会加深人类的悲剧。<!-- p7.s2 -->

[原文]
> Unquestionably, the promise of more freedom was responsible for luring more and more liberals along the socialist road, for blinding them to the conflict which exists between the basic principles of socialism and liberalism, and for often enabling socialists to usurp the very name of the old party of freedom. <!-- p7.s3 -->

[译文]
不容否认，"更多自由"的承诺引诱越来越多的自由主义者走上社会主义道路，使他们看不到社会主义与自由主义基本原则间的冲突，甚至让社会主义者得以窃取自由的老旗帜。<!-- p7.s3 -->

[原文]
> Socialism was embraced by the greater part of the intelligentsia as the apparent heir of the liberal tradition: therefore it is not surprising that to them the idea of socialism's leading to the opposite of liberty should appear inconceivable. <!-- p7.s4 -->

[译文]
大多数知识精英将社会主义视为自由主义传统的继承人——因此，对他们来说，"社会主义导向自由的反面"这个想法似乎是荒谬的，这并不奇怪。<!-- p7.s4 -->

## 第三节：自由概念的分裂与真相显露

[原文]
> In recent years, however, the old apprehensions of the unforeseen consequences of socialism have once more been strongly voiced from the most unexpected quarters. <!-- p8.s1 -->

[译文]
然而，近年来，对社会主义未预见后果的老担忧再次从最意想不到的声音中被表达出来。<!-- p8.s1 -->

[原文]
> Observer after observer, in spite of the contrary expectation with which he approached his subject, has been impressed with the extraordinary similarity in many respects of the conditions under "fascism" and "communism." <!-- p8.s2 -->

[译文]
一个接一个的观察者，尽管他们怀着相反的期待投入研究，却发现法西斯主义（fascism）和共产主义（communism）制度下的现实在许多方面惊人地相似。<!-- p8.s2 -->

[原文]
> While "progressives" in England and elsewhere were still deluding themselves that communism and fascism represented opposite poles, more and more people began to ask themselves whether these new tyrannies were not the outcome of the same tendencies. <!-- p8.s3 -->

[译文]
当英国和其他地方的"进步人士"仍在自欺欺人地认为共产主义与法西斯主义是对立两极时，越来越多的人开始怀疑：这些新的暴政是否出自同一源头？<!-- p8.s3 -->

[原文]
> Even communists must have been somewhat shaken by such testimonies as that of Max Eastman, Lenin's old friend, who found himself compelled to admit that "instead of being better, Stalinism is worse than fascism, more ruthless, barbarous, unjust, immoral, antidemocratic, unredeemed by any hope or scruple," and that it is "better described as superfascist"; and when we find the same author recognizing that "Stalinism is socialism, in the sense of being an inevitable although unforeseen political accompaniment of the nationalization and collectivization which he had relied upon as part of his plan for erecting a classless society," his conclusion clearly achieves wider significance. <!-- p8.s4 -->

[译文]
即使是共产主义者也应该被列宁老友马克斯·伊斯特曼这样的证词所震撼。伊斯特曼被迫承认："斯大林主义不仅没有更好，反而比法西斯主义更坏——更残酷、更蛮野、更不公正、更不道德、更反民主，毫无救赎的希望和理性。"他说斯大林主义"不如说是"超级法西斯主义"。更重要的是，伊斯特曼进一步认识到"斯大林主义就是社会主义，是国有化与集体化不可避免的政治伴生物——尽管这是未曾预见的——而这些正是他曾寄望于建立无阶级社会计划的一部分"。这个结论显然具有深远的意义。[注-原-5]<!-- p8.s4 -->

[原文]
> Mr. Eastman's case is perhaps the most remarkable, yet he is by no means the first or the only sympathetic observer of the Russian experiment to form similar conclusions. <!-- p9.s1 -->

[译文]
伊斯特曼的案例也许最为令人瞩目，但他绝非唯一一个对俄国实验抱有同情却得出类似结论的观察者。<!-- p9.s1 -->

[原文]
> Several years earlier W. H. Chamberlin, who in twelve years in Russia as an American correspondent had seen all his ideals shattered, summed up the conclusions of his studies there and in Germany and Italy in the statement that "socialism is certain to prove, in the beginning at least, the road NOT to freedom, but to dictatorship and counter-dictatorships, to civil war of the fiercest kind. Socialism achieved and maintained by democratic means seems definitely to belong to the world of utopias." <!-- p9.s2 -->

[译文]
数年前，美国记者W·H·张伯林在俄国度过了十二年，眼看自己的所有理想破灭。根据他在俄国、德国和意大利的研究，他总结出："社会主义肯定将被证明为——至少在初期——通往独裁与反独裁、通往最激烈内战的道路，而非通往自由的道路。通过民主手段实现和维持的社会主义，看来根本不属于现实，而属于乌托邦的世界。"[注-原-6]<!-- p9.s2 -->

[原文]
> Similarly a British writer, F. A. Voigt, after many years of close observation of developments in Europe as a foreign correspondent, concludes that "Marxism has led to Fascism and National Socialism, because, in all essentials, it is Fascism and National Socialism." <!-- p9.s3 -->

[译文]
同样地，英国作家F·A·沃伊特在多年担任驻外记者密切观察欧洲发展后得出结论："马克思主义导向法西斯主义与国家社会主义，因为在本质上，它就是这两者。"[注-原-7]<!-- p9.s3 -->

[原文]
> And Walter Lippmann has arrived at the conviction that "the generation to which we belong is now learning from experience what happens when men retreat from freedom to a coercive organization of their affairs. Though they promise themselves a more abundant life, they must in practice renounce it; as the organized direction increases, the variety of ends must give way to uniformity. That is the nemesis of the planned society and the authoritarian principle in human affairs." <!-- p9.s4 -->

[译文]
沃尔特·李普曼则得出了这样的结论："我们这一代正从现实中学习一个教训：当人们从自由退向对事务的强制性组织时会发生什么。尽管他们向自己许诺更丰裕的生活，但实际上必须放弃它。随着组织化指导的增强，目标的多样性被迫让位于统一。这就是计划社会和人类事务中专制原则的报应。"[注-原-8]<!-- p9.s4 -->

[原文]
> Many more similar statements from people in a position to judge might be selected from publications of recent years, particularly from those by men who as citizens of the now totalitarian countries have lived through the transformation and have been forced by their experience to revise many cherished beliefs. <!-- p10.s1 -->

[译文]
从近年来的出版物中，特别是来自那些亲身经历过极权转变、被迫修正自己信念的人的著述中，可以找到许多类似的见证。<!-- p10.s1 -->

[原文]
> We shall quote as one more example a German writer who expresses the same conclusion perhaps more justly than those already quoted. <!-- p10.s2 -->

[译文]
让我们引用一位德国作家的观点作为进一步的例证，他的表述或许比前面引用的更加客观。<!-- p10.s2 -->

[原文]
> "The complete collapse of the belief in the attainability of freedom and equality through Marxism," writes Peter Drucker, "has forced Russia to travel the same road toward a totalitarian, purely negative, non-economic society of unfreedom and inequality which Germany has been following. Not that communism and fascism are essentially the same. Fascism is the stage reached after communism has proved an illusion, and it has proved as much an illusion in Stalinist Russia as in pre-Hitler Germany." <!-- p10.s3 -->

[译文]
彼得·德鲁克写道："通过马克思主义实现自由与平等的信念彻底崩溃，迫使俄国走上了德国走过的同一条道路——通向极权主义、纯粹消极、非经济的专制与不平等社会。并非说共产主义与法西斯主义本质相同，而是法西斯主义是共产主义幻灭后进化出的阶段。在斯大林时代的俄国和希特勒前的德国，这个幻灭一样深刻。"[注-原-9]<!-- p10.s3 -->

## 第四节：从理想到现实的转变

[原文]
> No less significant is the intellectual history of many of the Nazi and Fascist leaders. <!-- p11.s1 -->

[译文]
同样值得注意的是许多纳粹与法西斯领导人的思想演变。<!-- p11.s1 -->

[原文]
> Everyone who has watched the growth of these movements in Italy or in Germany has been struck by the number of leading men, from Mussolini downward (and not excluding Laval and Quisling), who began as socialists and ended as Fascists or Nazis. <!-- p11.s2 -->

[译文]
任何观察过意大利或德国这些运动成长的人都会对一个现象感到震惊：那些领导人物——从墨索里尼往下，甚至包括拉瓦尔和吉斯林——许多都是从社会主义者变成法西斯主义者或纳粹分子的。[注-原-10][注-原-11]<!-- p11.s2 -->

[原文]
> And what is true of the leaders is even more true of the rank and file of the movement. <!-- p11.s3 -->

[译文]
对普通党员而言，这种转变更为普遍。<!-- p11.s3 -->

[原文]
> The relative ease with which a young communist could be converted into a Nazi or vice versa was generally known in Germany, best of all to the propagandists of the two parties. <!-- p11.s4 -->

[译文]
在德国，人们众所周知——两党的宣传人员尤其清楚——一个年轻的共产主义者转变为纳粹，或反之，相对容易。<!-- p11.s4 -->

[原文]
> Many a university teacher during the 1930s has seen English and American students return from the Continent uncertain whether they were communists or Nazis and certain only that they hated Western liberal civilization. <!-- p11.s5 -->

[译文]
1930年代许多大学教授都见过这样的情形：英美学生从欧洲大陆回来，不清楚自己是共产主义者还是纳粹，唯一确定的是他们憎恨西方自由文明。<!-- p11.s5 -->

[原文]
> It is true, of course, that in Germany before 1933, and in Italy before 1922, communists and Nazis or Fascists clashed more frequently with each other than with other parties. <!-- p12.s1 -->

[译文]
诚然，在1933年前的德国和1922年前的意大利，共产主义者与纳粹或法西斯分子之间的冲突比与其他政党的冲突更频繁。<!-- p12.s1 -->

[原文]
> They competed for the support of the same type of mind and reserved for each other the hatred of the heretic. <!-- p12.s2 -->

[译文]
他们争夺同一类人的支持，彼此视对方为异端。<!-- p12.s2 -->

[原文]
> But their practice showed how closely they are related. <!-- p12.s3 -->

[译文]
但他们的实际行动暴露了彼此深刻的亲缘关系。<!-- p12.s3 -->

[原文]
> To both, the real enemy, the man with whom they had nothing in common and whom they could not hope to convince, is the liberal of the old type. <!-- p12.s4 -->

[译文]
对两者来说，真正的敌人是老式的自由主义者——那个与他们毫无共同之处、根本无法被说服的人。<!-- p12.s4 -->

[原文]
> While to the Nazi the communist, and to the communist the Nazi, and to both the socialist, are potential recruits who are made of the right timber, although they have listened to false prophets, they both know that there can be no compromise between them and those who really believe in individual freedom. <!-- p12.s5 -->

[译文]
在纳粹眼中，共产主义者是可以争取的；在共产主义者眼中，纳粹是可以争取的；两者都认为社会主义者是可以争取的——他们都是同样的人，只是被不同的假先知迷惑了。但他们都深知，他们与那些真正信奉个人自由的人之间没有妥协的余地。<!-- p12.s5 -->

[原文]
> Lest this be doubted by people misled by official propaganda from either side, let me quote one more statement from an authority that ought not to be suspect. <!-- p13.s1 -->

[译文]
为了打消那些被官方宣传误导的人的疑虑，让我引用一位非常可信的权威人士的观点。<!-- p13.s1 -->

[原文]
> In an article under the significant title of "The Rediscovery of Liberalism," Professor Eduard Heimann, one of the leaders of German religious socialism, writes: "Hitlerism proclaims itself as both true democracy and true socialism, and the terrible truth is that there is a grain of truth for such claims—an infinitesimal grain, to be sure, but at any rate enough to serve as a basis for such fantastic distortions. Hitlerism even goes so far as to claim the role of protector of Christianity, and the terrible truth is that even this gross misinterpretation is able to make some impression. But one fact stands out with perfect clarity in all the fog: Hitler has never claimed to represent true liberalism. Liberalism then has the distinction of being the doctrine most hated by Hitler." <!-- p13.s2 -->

[译文]
在一篇题为"自由主义的重新发现"的文章中，德国宗教社会主义领袖爱德华·海曼教授写道："希特勒主义声称自己既是真正的民主又是真正的社会主义。可怕的真相是，这些主张确实有一点点真实的基础——虽然极其微小，但足以作为这种荒谬扭曲的依托。希特勒主义甚至声称自己是基督教的保护者，可怕的真相是，即使这种严重的曲解也能打动一些人。但在所有这些迷雾中，有一个事实晶莹剔透：希特勒从未宣称代表真正的自由主义。因此，自由主义有一个独特的地位——它是希特勒最憎恨的学说。"[注-原-12]<!-- p13.s2 -->

[原文]
> It should be added that this hatred had little occasion to show itself in practice merely because, by the time Hitler came to power, liberalism was to all intents and purposes dead in Germany. <!-- p13.s3 -->

[译文]
需要补充的是，这种仇恨在现实中很少表现出来，原因很简单：当希特勒掌权时，自由主义在德国已经死亡。<!-- p13.s3 -->

[原文]
> And it was socialism that had killed it. <!-- p13.s4 -->

[译文]
而杀死它的，正是社会主义。<!-- p13.s4 -->

[原文]
> While to many who have watched the transition from socialism to fascism at close quarters the connection between the two systems has become increasingly obvious, in the democracies the majority of people still believe that socialism and freedom can be combined. <!-- p14.s1 -->

[译文]
对于那些近距离观察从社会主义到法西斯主义转变的人来说，两个制度之间的联系已经显而易见。但在民主国家，大多数人仍然相信社会主义与自由可以相容。<!-- p14.s1 -->

[原文]
> There can be no doubt that most socialists here still believe profoundly in the liberal ideal of freedom and that they would recoil if they became convinced that the realization of their program would mean the destruction of freedom. <!-- p14.s2 -->

[译文]
毫无疑问，这里的大多数社会主义者仍然发自内心地相信自由主义关于自由的理想。一旦他们确信实现自己的纲领必然导致自由的毁灭，他们会退缩。<!-- p14.s2 -->

[原文]
> So little is the problem yet seen, so easily do the most irreconcilable ideals still live together, that we can still hear such contradictions in terms as "individualist socialism" seriously discussed. <!-- p14.s3 -->

[译文]
这个问题还未被人们真正看清，最相悖的理想竟能如此轻易地共处，以至于我们还能听到"个人主义社会主义"这样自相矛盾的概念被人认真讨论。<!-- p14.s3 -->

[原文]
> If this is the state of mind which makes us drift into a new world, nothing can be more urgent than that we should seriously examine the real significance of the evolution that has taken place elsewhere. <!-- p14.s4 -->

[译文]
如果正是这种心态使我们走向一个新世界，那么我们最迫切需要做的，就是认真研究其他国家已经经历的历史演变所真正揭示的含义。[注-译-1]<!-- p14.s4 -->

[原文]
> Although our conclusions will only confirm the apprehensions which others have already expressed, the reasons why this development cannot be regarded as accidental will not appear without a rather full examination of the main aspects of this transformation of social life. <!-- p14.s5 -->

[译文]
我们的结论虽然只是证实他人已有的担忧，但要显明为什么这种发展不能视为偶然，就必须充分考察社会生活中这种转变的主要方面。<!-- p14.s5 -->

[原文]
> That democratic socialism, the great utopia of the last few generations, is not only unachievable, but that to strive for it produces something so utterly different that few of those who now wish it would be prepared to accept the consequences, many will not believe until the connection has been laid bare in all its aspects. <!-- p14.s6 -->

[译文]
民主社会主义——过去几代人的伟大梦想——不仅是无法实现的，而且为之奋斗会产生出完全不同的东西，使得现在渴望它的人中，很少有谁会接受其后果。许多人要到这种联系的全部方面都被揭露出来，才会相信这一点。<!-- p14.s6 -->

Baillière et cie.出版社,1878年],第26页注)。这种混淆最明确的捍卫者,意味深长的是,是美国左翼主义的主要哲学家约翰·杜威,根据他的说法,\"自由是做具体事情的有效权力\",因此\"对自由的要求就是对权力的要求\"。参见约翰·杜威,《自由与社会控制》,《社会前沿》第2卷,1935年11月,第41页。

[注-原-6] W. H. 张伯林,《集体主义:一个虚假的乌托邦》(纽约:Macmillan出版社,1937年),第202-203页。作家和记者威廉·亨利·张伯林(1897-1969)于1922年作为《基督教科学箴言报》记者前往莫斯科。尽管最初同情革命事业,但他很快对斯大林主义感到幻灭。

[注-原-7] F. A. 沃伊特,《归于凯撒》(纽约:G. P. Putnam's Sons出版社,1938年),第95页。英国记者和作家弗雷德里克·奥古斯都·沃伊特(1892-1957)在两次世界大战之间担任《曼彻斯特卫报》驻柏林记者。我无法在沃伊特的书中找到引用的段落,尽管以下几行,摘自第35页,表达了类似的情感:\"马克思主义只是一个历史兴趣的现象,因为它甚至在其主要据点也失败了,如果不是它与国家社会主义如此密切相关的话。没有马克思主义,国家社会主义是不可想象的。\"沃伊特在他的书中指出了马克思主义与国家社会主义之间以及列宁与希特勒之间的相似之处。

[注-原-10] 关于许多法西斯领导人思想历程的启发性描述,可见于罗伯特·米歇尔斯(他本人是前马克思主义法西斯主义者),《社会主义与法西斯主义作为意大利的政治潮流:历史研究》第2卷,《意大利的社会主义与法西斯主义》(慕尼黑:Meyer and Jessen出版社,1925年),第264-66页,第311-12页。

[注-原-11] 法国政治家皮埃尔·拉瓦尔(1883-1945)在维希政权期间担任贝当元帅的副手,随后担任总理。解放后他作为通敌者被处决。挪威外交官维德孔·吉斯林(1887-1945)于1933年成立了以德国国家社会主义党为模板的民族团结党,并在占领期间担任傀儡总理。他的名字已成为通敌的同义词。吉斯林在战争结束时被审判并处决。

[注-原-12] 爱德华·海曼,《自由主义的重新发现》,《社会研究》第8卷,1941年11月,第479页。值得在此回忆的是,无论出于什么原因,希特勒认为在1941年2月的一次公开演讲中宣称\"基本上国家社会主义和马克思主义是一样的\"是权宜之计。参见文章《希特勒先生2月24日的演讲》,《国际新闻公报》(由皇家国际事务研究所出版)第18卷,1941年3月8日,第269页。爱德华·海曼(1889-1967)从1925年到1933年在汉堡大学任教,1933年逃离德国,在纽约社会研究新学院任职。

### 译注

[注-译-1] "其他地方"特指俄国、德国、意大利等已经历从社会主义向极权制度转变的国家。本章第三、四节通过伊斯特曼、张伯林等观察者的论述详细考察了这一历史进程。这些历史演变向我们揭示的深层原因或教训是：为什么社会主义制度必然（而非偶然）导向专制与极权。这是作者论证的核心——这一转变不是意外，而是社会主义内在逻辑的必然结果。

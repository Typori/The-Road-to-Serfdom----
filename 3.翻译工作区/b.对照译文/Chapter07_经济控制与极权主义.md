# Economic Control and Totalitarianism
# 经济控制与极权主义

> 摘要：本章论证了经济控制导向极权主义的必然性。计划者承诺经济领域的专制统治不会影响政治自由，但这是一个致命的幻觉。经济控制实际上是对人类生活全部方面的控制，因为在现代社会中，个人的几乎每个方面都依赖于经济活动。本章深入分析经济自由如何关乎个人尊严、自由选择和人生意义。

## 第一节：计划的虚假承诺与经济控制的真实含义

[原文]
> The control of the production of wealth is the control of human life itself. —Hilaire Belloc

[译文]
> 对财富生产的控制就是对人类生活本身的控制。——希拉尔·贝洛克<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> Most planners who have seriously considered the practical aspects of their task have little doubt that a directed economy must be run on more or less dictatorial lines. That the complex system of interrelated activities, if it is to be consciously directed at all, must be directed by a single staff of experts, and that ultimate responsibility and power must rest in the hands of a commander-in-chief whose actions must not be fettered by democratic procedure, is too obvious a consequence of underlying ideas of central planning not to command fairly general assent.

[译文]
> 大多数认真思考过其任务实践方面的计划者都毫无疑问地相信，一个有向的经济必须以或多或少的专制方式运行。这样一个复杂的相互关联活动系统，若要得到有意识的指导，就必须由一个单一的专家团队来指导；最终的责任和权力必须掌握在一位统帅的手中，其行为不能受民主程序的束缚——这是中央计划的基本理想的逻辑必然，足以获得相当广泛的赞同。<!-- p1.s1 -->

[原文]
> The consolation our planners offer us is that this authoritarian direction will apply "only" to economic matters. One of the most prominent economic planners, Stuart Chase, assures us, for instance, that in a planned society "political democracy can remain if it confines itself to all but economic matters."2 Such assurances are usually accompanied by the suggestion that, by giving up freedom in what are, or ought to be, the less important aspects of our lives, we shall obtain greater freedom in the pursuit of higher values. On this ground people who abhor the idea of a political dictatorship often clamor for a dictator in the economic field.

[译文]
> 计划者为此提供的安慰是这种权威指导将\"仅仅\"适用于经济事务。例如，最著名的经济计划家之一斯图尔特·蔡斯向我们保证，在计划社会中\"只要政治民主将自己限制在经济之外的所有事务，政治民主就可以保持存在\"。2 这类保证通常伴随着这样的建议：通过放弃生活中相对不重要的方面的自由，我们将获得在追求更高价值时的更大自由。基于这个逻辑，许多厌恶政治独裁理想的人往往会呼吁在经济领域建立独裁统治。<!-- p1.s2 -->

[原文]
> The arguments used appeal to our best instincts and often attract the finest minds. If planning really did free us from the less important cares and so made it easier to render our existence one of plain living and high thinking, who would wish to belittle such an ideal? If our economic activities really concerned only the inferior or even more sordid sides of life, of course we ought to endeavor by all means to find a way to relieve ourselves from the excessive care for material ends and, leaving them to be cared for by some piece of utilitarian machinery, set our minds free for the higher things of life.

[译文]
> 这些论证吸引了我们最高尚的本能，往往也吸引最聪敏的思想。若计划确实能把我们从相对不重要的顾虑中解放出来，从而让我们的生活变成简朴而致力于崇高思想的存在，谁会希望贬低这样的理想呢？若我们的经济活动真的只涉及生活中低级的甚至更肮脏的方面，那当然我们应该尽力寻找办法把自己从对物质目标的过度关切中解放出来，把这些事交给某种功利性的机器去处理，从而为生活中的高级事物解放我们的心灵。<!-- p1.s3 -->

[原文]
> Unfortunately, the assurance people derive from this belief that the power which is exercised over economic life is a power over matters of secondary importance only, and which makes them take lightly the threat to the freedom of our economic pursuits, is altogether unwarranted. It is largely a consequence of the erroneous belief that there are purely economic ends separate from the other ends of life. Yet, apart from the pathological case of the miser, there is no such thing. The ultimate ends of the activities of reasonable beings are never economic. Strictly speaking, there is no "economic motive" but only economic factors conditioning our striving for other ends.

[译文]
> 然而，人们从相信对经济生活施加的权力仅仅是对次要事项的权力这一信念中所获得的保证是完全没有根据的。这在很大程度上源于一个错误的信念，即存在与生活其他目标分离开的纯粹经济目标。但除了守财奴这种病态情况外，根本不存在这样的东西。理性人活动的最终目标从不是经济性的。严格来讲，不存在\"经济动机\"，而只存在制约我们追求其他目标的经济因素。<!-- p1.s4 -->

[原文]
> What in ordinary language is misleadingly called the "economic motive" means merely the desire for general opportunity, the desire for power to achieve unspecified ends. If we strive for money, it is because it offers us the widest choice in enjoying the fruits of our efforts. Because in modern society it is through the limitation of our money incomes that we are made to feel the restrictions which our relative poverty still imposes upon us, many have come to hate money as the symbol of these restrictions. But this is to mistake for the cause the medium through which a force makes itself felt. It would be much truer to say that money is one of the greatest instruments of freedom ever invented by man. It is money which in existing society opens an astounding range of choice to the poor man—a range greater than that which not many generations ago was open to the wealthy.

[译文]
> 普通语言中被误导地称为\"经济动机\"的东西仅仅意味着对总体机遇的渴望，即获得达成未明确目标之权力的渴望。我们之所以追求金钱，是因为它为我们提供了最广泛的选择来享受我们努力的果实。在现代社会中，正是因为我们的金钱收入的限制使我们感受到相对贫困对我们的束缚，许多人因此开始仇恨金钱，把它看作这些束缚的象征。但这是把力量传导的媒介误认为了原因。更恰当的说法应该是：金钱是人类曾发明的最伟大的自由工具之一。正是金钱在现存社会中为穷人开放了一个令人惊讶的选择范围——一个比几代前向富人开放的范围还要广阔的范围。<!-- p1.s5 -->

[原文]
> We shall better understand the significance of this service of money if we consider what it would really mean if, as so many socialists characteristically propose, the "pecuniary motive" were largely displaced by "noneconomic incentives." If all rewards, instead of being offered in money, were offered in the form of public distinctions or privileges, positions of power over other men, or better housing or better food, opportunities for travel or education, this would merely mean that the recipient would no longer be allowed to choose and that whoever fixed the reward determined not only its size but also the particular form in which it should be enjoyed.

[译文]
> 若我们考虑当许多社会主义者典型地提议的那样\"金钱动机\"被大量\"非经济激励\"所取代时会真正意味着什么，我们就会更好地理解金钱的这种功能的重要性。若所有奖励不是以金钱的形式而是以公众荣誉或特权、对他人的权力位置、更好的住房或更好的食物、旅行或教育的机会的形式提供，这仅仅意味着接收者将不再被允许选择，而那个确定奖励的人将不仅决定其大小，还要决定它应该以何种特定形式被享受。<!-- p1.s6 -->

## 第二节：经济自由与生活选择的全面性

[原文]
> Once we realize that there is no separate economic motive and that an economic gain or economic loss is merely a gain or a loss where it is still in our power to decide which of our needs or desires shall be affected, it is also easier to see the important kernel of truth in the general belief that economic matters affect only the less important ends of life and to understand the contempt in which "merely" economic considerations are often held. In a sense this is quite justified in a market economy—but only in such a free economy. So long as we can freely dispose over our income and all our possessions, economic loss will always deprive us only of what we regard as the least important of the desires we were able to satisfy. A "merely" economic loss is thus one whose effect we can still make fall on our less important needs, while when we say that the value of something we have lost is much greater than its economic value, or that it cannot even be estimated in economic terms, this means that we must bear the loss where it falls. And similarly with an economic gain. Economic changes, in other words, usually affect only the fringe, the "margin," of our needs.

[译文]
> 一旦我们认识到不存在独立的经济动机，而经济获利或经济损失仅仅是我们仍有权决定我们的哪些需求或欲望受到影响的获利或损失，我们也就更容易看到普遍信念中关于经济事项仅影响人生中相对不重要目标的重要真理核心，也更容易理解为什么\"仅仅\"经济考虑常被鄙视。在某种意义上这在市场经济中是完全有理的——但仅在这样的自由经济中。只要我们能自由支配我们的收入和全部财产，经济损失将永远只是剥夺我们认为最不重要的那些欲望。\"仅仅\"经济损失因此是影响我们仍有权让其落在不那么重要需求上的损失，而当我们说某物的价值远超其经济价值，或甚至根本无法用经济术语估量时，这意味着我们必须承受这种损失无论它落在哪里。经济获利也是同理。总之，经济变化通常仅影响我们需求的\"边际\"。<!-- p2.s1 -->

[原文]
> There are many things which are more important than anything which economic gains or losses are likely to affect, which for us stand high above the amenities and even above many of the necessities of life which are affected by the economic ups and downs. Compared with them, the "filthy lucre," the question whether we are economically somewhat worse or better off, seems of little importance. This makes many people believe that anything which, like economic planning, affects only our economic interests cannot seriously interfere with the more basic values of life.

[译文]
> 生活中许多东西比经济得失可能影响的任何东西都更为重要，对我们来说高于舒适设施，甚至高于受经济波动影响的许多生活必需品。与之相比，\"赤裸裸的金钱\"，即我们在经济上是稍好还是稍坏这个问题，似乎微不足道。这使许多人相信，像经济计划这样仅仅影响我们经济利益的东西，无法严重威胁生活中更基本的价值观。<!-- p2.s2 -->

[原文]
> This, however, is an erroneous conclusion. Economic values are less important to us than many things precisely because in economic matters we are free to decide what to us is more, and what less, important. Or, as we might say, because in the present society it is we who have to solve the economic problems of our lives. To be controlled in our economic pursuits means to be always controlled unless we declare our specific purpose. Or, since when we declare our specific purpose we shall also have to get it approved, we should really be controlled in everything.

[译文]
> 然而这个结论是错误的。经济价值对我们来说比许多事物都不重要，正是因为在经济事项上我们有自由决定什么对我们更重要、什么不重要。换句话说，正是因为在当今社会中是我们自己必须解决生活的经济问题。而如果我们在经济追求中被控制，就意味着我们始终处于被控制之下，除非我们声明我们的具体目的。或者，既然我们声明具体目的后还需要获得批准，我们实际上应该在所有事情上都被控制。<!-- p2.s3 -->

[原文]
> The question raised by economic planning is, therefore, not merely whether we shall be able to satisfy what we regard as our more or less important needs in the way we prefer. It is whether it shall be we who decide what is more, and what is less, important for us, or whether this is to be decided by the planner. Economic planning would not affect merely those of our marginal needs that we have in mind when we speak contemptuously about the merely economic. It would, in effect, mean that we as individuals should no longer be allowed to decide what we regard as marginal.

[译文]
> 因此经济计划所提出的问题不仅仅是我们是否能够以我们偏好的方式满足我们认为或多或少重要的需求。而是应该由我们来决定什么对我们更重要、什么不重要，还是由计划者来决定。经济计划不会仅仅影响我们提到\"仅仅经济\"时所想的边际需求。它实际上意味着作为个人的我们将不再被允许决定什么我们认为是边际的。<!-- p2.s4 -->

## 第三节：计划权力的全面性与个人自由的必然消亡

[原文]
> The authority directing all economic activity would control not merely the part of our lives which is concerned with inferior things; it would control the allocation of the limited means for all our ends. And whoever controls all economic activity controls the means for all our ends and must therefore decide which are to be satisfied and which not. This is really the crux of the matter. Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends. And whoever has sole control of the means must also determine which ends are to be served, which values are to be rated higher and which lower—in short, what men should believe and strive for. Central planning means that the economic problem is to be solved by the community instead of by the individual; but this involves that it must also be the community, or rather its representatives, who must decide the relative importance of the different needs.

[译文]
> 指导所有经济活动的当局不仅会控制我们生活中涉及低级事项的部分；它会控制所有我们目标的有限手段的配置。凡是控制所有经济活动的人就控制了我们所有目标的手段，因此必然要决定哪些应该被满足，哪些不应该。这才是问题的关键。经济控制不仅仅是对人类生活某一能被分离出去的部分的控制；它是对我们所有目标的手段的控制。而凡是对手段拥有唯一控制权的人，也必然要确定哪些目标应该被服务，哪些价值应该被评为更高，哪些更低——简言之，人们应该相信什么和为什么而奋斗。中央计划意味着经济问题应该由社区而非个人来解决；但这同时意味着必须是社区，或者说其代表，来决定不同需求的相对重要性。<!-- p3.s1 -->

[原文]
> The so-called economic freedom which the planners promise us means precisely that we are to be relieved of the necessity of solving our own economic problems and that the bitter choices which this often involves are to be made for us. Since under modern conditions we are for almost everything dependent on means which our fellow-men provide, economic planning would involve direction of almost the whole of our life. There is hardly an aspect of it, from our primary needs to our relations with our family and friends, from the nature of our work to the use of our leisure, over which the planner would not exercise his "conscious control."

[译文]
> 计划者所承诺的所谓\"经济自由\"正是指我们被解除了解决自己经济问题的必要性，而常常伴随其中的痛苦选择将为我们做出。在现代条件下，由于我们对几乎一切事物都依赖于他人所提供的手段，经济计划将涉及对我们几乎生活全部的指导。从我们的基本需求到与家人和朋友的关系，从我们工作的性质到我们闲暇时间的使用，几乎没有一个我们生活的方面计划者不会对其行使其\"有意识的控制\"。<!-- p3.s2 -->

[原文]
> The power of the planner over our private lives would be no less complete if he chose not to exercise it by direct control of our consumption. Although a planned society would probably to some extent employ rationing and similar devices, the power of the planner over our private lives does not depend on this and would be hardly less effective if the consumer were nominally free to spend his income as he pleased. The source of this power over all consumption which in a planned society the authority would possess would be its control over production.

[译文]
> 即使计划者选择不通过直接控制我们的消费来行使权力，其对我们私生活的权力也不会减弱。虽然计划社会可能在某种程度上会采用配给和类似措施，但计划者对我们私生活的权力并不取决于此，即使消费者名义上可以自由支配其收入也不会大大减弱。计划社会中当局对所有消费的权力来源将是其对生产的控制。<!-- p3.s3 -->

[原文]
> Our freedom of choice in a competitive society rests on the fact that, if one person refuses to satisfy our wishes, we can turn to another. But if we face a monopolist we are at his mercy. And an authority directing the whole economic system would be the most powerful monopolist conceivable. While we need probably not be afraid that such an authority would exploit this power in the manner in which a private monopolist would do so, while its purpose would presumably not be the extortion of maximum financial gain, it would have complete power to decide what we are to be given and on what terms. It would not only decide what commodities and services were to be available and in what quantities; it would be able to direct their distribution between districts and groups and could, if it wished, discriminate between persons to any degree it liked. If we remember why planning is advocated by most people, can there be much doubt that this power would be used for the ends of which the authority approves and to prevent the pursuits of ends which it disapproves?

[译文]
> 我们在竞争社会中的选择自由建立在这样一个事实基础上：如果一个人拒绝满足我们的愿望，我们可以转向另一个人。但如果我们面对一个垄断者，我们就任其摆布。而指导整个经济体系的当局将是可以想象的最强大的垄断者。虽然我们可能不需要担心这样的当局会像私人垄断者那样剥削这种权力，虽然其目的可能不是榨取最大的经济利益，但它会拥有完全的权力来决定我们被给予什么以及在什么条件下。它不仅会决定什么商品和服务可用以及数量如何，还能够指导它们在地区和群体之间的分配，若它愿意，可以在任何程度上区别对待个人。若我们想起为什么大多数人提倡计划，那么这种权力会被用于当局赞同的目标和阻止它反对的目标的追求，这还有什么疑问吗？<!-- p3.s4 -->

[原文]
> The power conferred by the control of production and prices is almost unlimited. In a competitive society the prices we have to pay for a thing, the rate at which we can get one thing for another, depend on the quantities of other things of which by taking one, we deprive the other members of society. This price is not determined by the conscious will of anybody. And if one way of achieving our ends proves too expensive for us, we are free to try other ways. The obstacles in our path are not due to someone's disapproving of our ends but to the fact that the same means are also wanted elsewhere. In a directed economy, where the authority watches over the ends pursued, it is certain that it would use its powers to assist some ends and to prevent the realization of others. Not our own view, but somebody else's, of what we ought to like or dislike would determine what we should get. And since the authority would have the power to thwart any efforts to elude its guidance, it would control what we consume almost as effectively as if it directly told us how to spend our income.

[译文]
> 通过控制生产和价格而赋予的权力几乎是无限的。在竞争社会中，我们为某样东西必须支付的价格、我们能够以某样东西换取另一样东西的比率，取决于通过拿走某样东西我们使社会其他成员失去的其他东西的数量。这个价格不是由任何人的有意识意愿决定的。若一种实现我们目标的方式对我们来说太昂贵，我们可以自由地尝试其他方式。我们道路上的障碍不是由于某人不赞同我们的目标，而是由于同样的手段也在别处被需要。在一个有向的经济中，当局对被追求的目标进行监视，它肯定会使用其权力来协助某些目标，阻止其他目标的实现。不是我们自己的观点，而是别人关于我们应该喜欢或不喜欢什么的观点会决定我们应该得到什么。而且由于当局拥有阻挠任何努力逃脱其指导的权力，它会控制我们的消费几乎就像它直接告诉我们如何支配我们的收入一样有效。<!-- p3.s5 -->

## 第四节：工作选择的自由与人类尊严

[原文]
> Not only in our capacity as consumers, however, and not even mainly in that capacity, would the will of the authority shape and "guide" our daily lives. It would do so even more in our position as producers. These two aspects of our lives cannot be separated; and as for most of us the time we spend at our work is a large part of our whole lives, and as our job usually also determines the place where and the people among whom we live, some freedom in choosing our work is, probably, even more important for our happiness than freedom to spend our income during the hours of leisure.

[译文]
> 不仅作为消费者，甚至主要不是作为消费者，当局的意愿会塑造并\"指导\"我们的日常生活。它在我们作为生产者的位置上的影响甚至更大。我们生活的这两个方面无法分离；而且对我们大多数人来说，我们花在工作上的时间是我们整个生活的很大一部分，而且我们的工作通常也决定了我们生活的地点和生活的人群，某种程度上的工作选择自由对我们的幸福可能甚至比在闲暇时间支配我们收入的自由更为重要。<!-- p4.s1 -->

[原文]
> No doubt it is true that even in the best of worlds this freedom will be very limited. Few people ever have an abundance of choice of occupation. But what matters is that we have some choice, that we are not absolutely tied to a particular job which has been chosen for us, or which we may have chosen in the past, and that if one position becomes quite intolerable, or if we set our heart on another, there is almost always a way for the able, some sacrifice at the price of which he may achieve his goal. Nothing makes conditions more unbearable than the knowledge that no effort of ours can change them; and even if we should never have the strength of mind to make the necessary sacrifice, the knowledge that we could escape if we only strove hard enough makes many otherwise intolerable positions bearable.

[译文]
> 毫无疑问，即使在最好的世界中这种自由也会非常有限。很少有人能获得极其充分的职业选择。但重要的是我们有某种选择，我们不是绝对被束缚于一个为我们选择的或我们过去可能选择的特定工作，而是当某个位置变得完全无法忍受时，或当我们对另一个充满渴望时，对有能力的人来说几乎总是存在一种方式，付出某种代价他可以实现他的目标。没有什么比知道我们的任何努力都无法改变条件更让条件变得无法忍受的；而且即使我们可能永远没有做出必要牺牲的意志力，知道只要我们足够努力就能逃脱这一事实使许多本来无法忍受的位置变得可以忍受。<!-- p4.s2 -->

[原文]
> This is not to say that in this respect all is for the best in our present world, or has been so in the most liberal past, and that there is not much that could be done to improve the opportunities of choice open to the people. Here as elsewhere the state can do a great deal to help the spreading of knowledge and information and to assist mobility. But the point is that the kind of state action which really would increase opportunity is almost precisely the opposite of the "planning" which is now generally advocated and practiced. Most planners, it is true, promise that in the new planned world free choice of occupation will be scrupulously preserved or even increased. But there they promise more than they can possibly fulfill. If they want to plan, they must control the entry into the different trades and occupations, or the terms of remuneration, or both. In almost all known instances of planning, the establishment of such controls and restrictions was among the first measures taken. If such control were universally practiced and exercised by a single planning authority, one needs little imagination to see what would become of the "free choice of occupation" promised. The "freedom of choice" would be purely fictitious, a mere promise to practice no discrimination where in the nature of the case discrimination must be practiced, and where all one could hope would be that the selection would be made on what the authority believed to be objective grounds.

[译文]
> 这不是说在这方面我们当今的世界中一切都是最好的，或过去最自由的时代也是如此，也不是说没有很多东西可以做来改善向人民开放的选择机遇。这里和其他地方一样，国家可以在帮助知识和信息的传播以及帮助流动性方面做很多事。但关键是，真正会增加机遇的国家行为与现在通常宣传和实践的\"计划\"几乎完全相反。诚然，大多数计划者承诺在新的计划世界中自由的职业选择将被严格保留或甚至增加。但在那里他们承诺了他们无法可能履行的东西。若他们要计划，他们必须控制进入不同行业和职业的入口，或报酬的条款，或两者。在几乎所有已知的计划实例中，建立这样的控制和限制是最初采取的措施之一。若这样的控制得到普遍实践并由单一的计划当局行使，人们不需要太多想象力就能看到所承诺的\"自由职业选择\"会变成什么。\"选择自由\"将是纯粹虚幻的，仅仅是一个承诺不在本质上必须进行区别对待的地方进行区别对待，而唯一能希望的是选择是基于当局认为是客观标准的基础上进行的。<!-- p4.s3 -->

[原文]
> There would be little difference if the planning authority confined itself to fixing the terms of employment and tried to regulate numbers by adjusting these terms. By prescribing the remuneration, it would no less effectively bar groups of people from entering many trades than by specifically excluding them. A rather plain girl who badly wants to become a saleswoman, a weakly boy who has set his heart on a job where his weakness handicaps him, as well as in general the apparently less able or less suitable are not necessarily excluded in a competitive society; if they value the position sufficiently they will frequently be able to get a start by a financial sacrifice and will later make good through qualities which at first are not so obvious. But when the authority fixes the remunerations for a whole category and the selection among the candidates is made by an objective test, the strength of their desire for the job will count for very little. The person whose qualifications are not of the standard type, or whose temperament is not of the ordinary kind, will no longer be able to come to special arrangements with an employer whose dispositions will fit in with his special needs: the person who prefers irregular hours or even a happy-go-lucky existence with a small and perhaps uncertain income to a regular routine will no longer have the choice. Conditions will be without exception what in some measure they inevitably are in a large organization—or rather worse, because there will be no possibility of escape. We shall no longer be free to be rational or efficient only when and where we think it worth while; we shall all have to conform to the standards which the planning authority must fix in order to simplify its task. To make this immense task manageable, it will have to reduce the diversity of human capacities and inclinations to a few categories of readily interchangeable units and deliberately to disregard minor personal differences.

[译文]
> 若计划当局将自己局限于规定就业条款并试图通过调整这些条款来调节数量，差异不会很大。通过规定报酬，它会像直接排除他们一样有效地阻止一些人群进入许多行业。一个相当普通想要成为销售女员的女孩，一个体弱想要从事会因体弱而处于劣势的工作的男孩，以及总体上看起来不够有能力或不太合适的人在竞争社会中不必然被排除；若他们足够重视这个位置，他们通常可以通过经济牺牲来开始，之后可以通过一开始不太明显的品质而成功。但当当局为整个类别规定报酬而候选人的选择是通过客观测试进行的时，他们对工作的渴望强度将计数很少。其资格不是标准类型的或气质不是常见类型的人将不再能够与气质适合其特殊需求的雇主达成特殊安排：偏好不规则工作时间甚至带着小的也许不确定的收入过快活人生而不是规则常规的人将不再有选择。条件将无例外地是在大型组织中某种程度上不可避免是的样子——或者说更糟，因为将没有逃脱的可能。我们将不再自由地仅在我们认为值得的时间和地点有理性或高效率；我们都将不得不遵守计划当局为简化其任务必须确定的标准。为了使这个巨大的任务可处理，它将不得不把人类能力和倾向的多样性简化为几类容易互换的单位，并有意地忽视细微的个人差异。<!-- p4.s4 -->

[原文]
> Although the professed aim of planning would be that man should cease to be a mere means, in fact—since it would be impossible to take account in the plan of individual likes and dislikes—the individual would more than ever become a mere means, to be used by the authority in the service of such abstractions as the "social welfare" or the "good of the community."

[译文]
> 虽然计划的声称目标将是人应该停止成为仅仅的手段，但实际上——由于在计划中考虑个人好恶是不可能的——个人会比以往任何时候都更成为一个纯粹的手段，被当局用来服务诸如\"社会福祉\"或\"社区的善\"这样的抽象概念。<!-- p4.s5 -->

[原文]
> That in a competitive society most things can be had at a price—though it is often a cruelly high price we have to pay—is a fact the importance of which can hardly be overrated. The alternative is not, however, complete freedom of choice, but orders and prohibitions which must be obeyed and, in the last resort, the favor of the mighty.

[译文]
> 在竞争社会中，大多数东西都可以以某个价格获得——虽然我们常常必须付出残忍的高价——这是一个其重要性几乎无法被夸大的事实。然而替代品不是完整的选择自由，而是必须被遵守的命令和禁令，以及在最后分析中对权力者的恩宠的依赖。<!-- p4.s6 -->

[原文]
> It is significant of the confusion prevailing on all these subjects that it should have become a cause for reproach that in a competitive society almost everything can be had at a price. If the people who protest against having the higher values of life brought into the "cash nexus" really mean that we should not be allowed to sacrifice our lesser needs in order to preserve the higher values, and that the choice should be made for us, this demand must be regarded as rather peculiar and scarcely testifies to great respect for the dignity of the individual. That life and health, beauty and virtue, honor and peace of mind, can often be preserved only at considerable material cost, and that somebody must make the choice, is as undeniable as that we all are sometimes not prepared to make the material sacrifices necessary to protect those higher values against all injury.

[译文]
> 在竞争社会中几乎一切都可以以价格获得这一点变成了一种指责对象，这标志着在所有这些问题上普遍的混乱。若反对把生活的高级价值带入\"金钱关系\"的人真的意思是我们应该不被允许为了保护高级价值而牺牲我们的低级需求，而选择应该为我们做出，那么这种要求必须被看作相当古怪的，而且几乎不能证明对个人尊严的伟大尊重。生命和健康、美和品德、荣誉和心灵的平和常常只能以相当的物质代价被保护，而且某个人必须做出选择，这和我们都有时不准备做出为了保护那些高级价值免受所有伤害而必要的物质牺牲一样不可否认。<!-- p4.s7 -->
